He &apos;s right , cause if you &apos;re just gonna , like , break his heart , that &apos;s the kind of thing that can wait .

But you ... you &apos;re a <unk> .
You &apos;re like the most generous man I ever met .
I mean ... you &apos;re <unk> a woman .
Uh , so , uh , Rach , uh ... do you wanna save this <unk> paper , I mean , it &apos;s only a little bit <unk> ... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out ?

Y &apos;know what I mean ?
I mean , it &apos;s Ross .

Oh my God , me too !
Oh !
Oh , we &apos;d be like <unk> !
Y &apos;know what the best part is ?
The best part is that you already know everything about him !
I mean , it &apos;s like starting on the fifteenth date !
Yeah , but , y &apos;know , it &apos;s ... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date .
Another good point .
No , I mean , I mean , when you &apos;re at the fifteenth date , y &apos;know , you &apos;re already in a very <unk> place .
Y &apos;know , it &apos;s ... you &apos;re <unk> .
Huh ?
Well , I mean , then what happens if it doesn &apos;t work out ?
Why isn &apos;t it working out ?
I don &apos;t know ... sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
Is he not cute enough for you ?
No !
Does he not make enough money ?
No , I &apos;m just .... Maybe there &apos;s someone else .
Wha ... Is there ?
Is there someone else ?
No !
There is .. there is <unk> else !
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother ? ! ?
Hey , big ... Shhhh !
... <unk> .
She &apos;s still asleep .
So how &apos;d it go ?
Oh , it was amazing .
You know how you always think you &apos;re great in bed ?
The fact that you &apos;d even ask that question <unk> how little you know me .
Well , it &apos;s like , last night , I couldn &apos;t do the thing that usually makes me great .
So I had to do all this other stuff .
And the response I got ... man , oh man , it was like a <unk> tape parade !
Yes , I know , as it happens my room is very very close to the parade <unk> .
It was amazing !
And not just for her ... <unk> .
For me , too .
It &apos;s like , all of a sudden , I &apos;m blind .
But all my other <unk> are <unk> , y &apos;know ?
It &apos;s like ...
I was able to appreciate it on another level .
I didn &apos;t know you had another level .
I know !
<unk> did I !
Hey , great <unk> !
Birthday present ?
Yeah .
Oh , from who ?
From you .
I <unk> the <unk> you got me .
Well , it &apos;s the thought .
Hey , doesn &apos;t Ross &apos;s flight get in in a couple hours ?
At gate <unk> ?
Uh , yeah .
Uh , Monica , y &apos;know , honey , I &apos;ve been thinking about it and I &apos;ve decided <unk> whole Ross thing , it &apos;s just not a good idea .
Oh , why ?
Because , I feel like I wouldn &apos;t just be going out with him .
I would be going out with all of you .
Oh , and there would just be all this pressure , and I don &apos;t wanna ... No , no , no , no , no , no pressure , no pressure !
Monica , nothing has even happened yet , and you &apos;re already so ...
I am not &apos; so &apos; !
OK , I was a <unk> bit weird at first , but ...
I &apos;ll be good .
I promise .
Who is it ?
It &apos;s me , Carl .
C &apos;mon up .
<unk> my brother &apos;s back ?
... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won &apos;t be hearing from me .
<unk> hundred bucks !
Alright , you did it !
Do we have any fruit ?
Man , hell of a two weeks , huh ?
Y &apos;know what , though ?
I really feel like I learned something .
Really ?
So , you &apos;re gonna stick with this &apos; it &apos;s all for her &apos; thing ?
What , are you crazy ?
When a blind man gets his <unk> back , does he walk around like this ?
I &apos;m just sayin &apos; , if I see one more picture of Ed <unk> , <unk> in that stupid <unk> car , I &apos;m gonna shoot myself !
I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong ...
I &apos;m not against <unk> issues per se .... it &apos;s just that guy !
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;d rather go out with him than me .
Would you excuse me , please ?
I &apos;m trying to have a date here .
Fine , just stop thinking about me .
Can &apos;t do it , can you ?
So I &apos;m thinking about you .
So what ?
I don &apos;t get it .
What do you see in this guy , anyway ?
Well ... he happens to be a very nice ... guy ....
I mean , come on , buddy , get a real car !
Rachel , come on .
Give us a chance .
Ross , it &apos;s too hard .
No , no , no ... why , because it might get weird for everyone else ?
Who cares about them .
This is about us .
Look , I-I &apos;ve been in love with you since , like , the <unk> grade .
Ross , you &apos;re like my best friend .
I know .
If we broke up , and I lost you ... Whoa , whoa , whoa .
What makes you think we &apos;re gonna break up ?
Well , have you been involved with someone where you haven &apos;t broken up ?
No .
But ... it only has to happen once .
Look , you and I both know we are perfect for each other , right ?
I mean ... so , the only question is ... are you attracted to me ?
I don &apos;t know ...
I mean , I &apos;ve never looked at you that way before .
Well , start looking .
Wow .
Exactly !
And you just know I &apos;m gonna be the guy caught behind this <unk> in traffic !
Right !
You &apos;re right !
Heh ... y &apos;know ?
You know what ?
What ?
I forgot ...
I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport .
I am so sorry !
I &apos;m so ... if you want to stay , and finish your drinks , please do ....
I <unk> &apos;m sorry .
I-I-I gotta go .
I &apos;m sorry .
But ...
Excuse me , pardon me , excuse me , excuse me , sorry .
Hi .
For God &apos;s sake , will you let it go ?
There &apos;s no Rachel !
Oh , hey , hey , I got that .
Oh , thanks , sweetie .
No problem .
I cannot wait for you to meet my friends .
Really ?
Yeah .
You don &apos;t think they &apos;ll judge and <unk> me ?
No , no , they will .
I just ... uh ... Can &apos;t wait .
Come on , they &apos;re gonna love you .
Ok , so this is pretty much what &apos;s happened so far .
Ross was in love with Rachel since , you know , forever , but every time he tried to tell her , something kind of got in the way , like cats , and Italian guys .
Finally Chandler was like &quot; forget about her &quot; but when Ross was in China on his dig , Chandler let it <unk> that Ross was in love with Rachel .
She was like , &quot; Oh my god . &quot;
So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back , but what she didn &apos;t know was , that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman .
Uh-Oh !
So , that &apos;s pretty much everything you need to know .
But , enough about us .
So , how &apos;ve you been ?
Oh my god .
Oh my god .
Excuse me .
Move !
Move !
<unk> !
Excuse me !
Rach !

Um , this ?

Oh , I &apos;m so sorry .
I just gave away the ending , didn &apos;t I ?
Oh !
It &apos;s just , I just heard this story in the cab , and it is all I can think about .
This is amazing .
I mean , how , how did this happen ?
Well , Ross and I were in <unk> school together .
But we haven &apos;t seen each other since then .
Well I land in China , guess who &apos;s in charge of the dig .
Julie !
Julie , isn &apos;t that great ?
I mean , isn &apos;t that just <unk> , <unk> fantastic ?
It &apos;s an expression .
Well , we just wanted to say a quick hi , and then we &apos;re gonna go see the baby .
And then we &apos;ve gotta get some sleep .
Yeah , it &apos;s really 6 : 00 tomorrow night our time .
Well , listen , don &apos;t tell us what &apos;s gonna happen though , &apos; cause I like to be surprised .
Bye .
Hey , Rach , can I get some coffee ?
Yeah , sure .
Thank you .
Hey , Rach , can I get ... Did you talk to him ?
Not yet .
Then , no .
So what the hell happened to you in China ?
I mean , when last we left you , you were totally in love with , you know .
I know , I know I was , but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it &apos;s never gonna happen , move on .
You know whose voice that was ?
God ?
It was you , pal .
Well , maybe it was God , doing me .
Look , you were right .
She looks at me and sees a friend , that &apos;s all .
But then I met Julie , and I don &apos;t know , we &apos;re havin &apos; a great time .
And I have to say , I never would &apos;ve gone for it with her if it hadn &apos;t been for you .
Well , you owe me one , big guy .
Here &apos;s your lemonade .
I didn &apos;t order lemonade .
Oh .
Well then , you better go take that back because they &apos;re gonna charge you for that .
But ... <unk> , come on !
So uh , what did you find out ?
He said ... he said , he said that they &apos;re having a great time .
I &apos;m sorry .
But , the silver lining , if you wanna see it , is that he made the decision all by himself !
Without any outside help whatsoever .
How is that the silver lining ?
You have to really wanna see it .
<unk> , these are the guys who were picked last in gym .
Pheebes , you know what I &apos;m thinking ?
Oh , ok . How , it &apos;s been so long since you &apos;ve had sex , you &apos;re wondering if they &apos;ve changed it ?
No , although now that &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
All right , so what were you thinking ?
Well , I was thinking , that you gave the guys such great <unk> , I thought , maybe you &apos;d like to do mine ?
Ohh !
No .
Why not ?
Because , I &apos;m just , I &apos;m incredibly <unk> and an unbelievable control freak .
No you &apos;re not .
I know I &apos;m not , but you are , and I was trying to <unk> your feelings .

At his apartment .
Is this juice ?
Whoa , whoa .
And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe ?
Oh God , I know I &apos;m a pathetic <unk> .
Honey , you &apos;re not pathetic , you &apos;re sad .
People do stupid things when they &apos;re upset .
My god , if I had a <unk> for every guy I wish I hadn &apos;t ... , but this is about your horrible mistake .
Hi !
Hi .
Sorry we &apos;re late but we <unk> , there was touching .

I &apos;m glad it &apos;s not a problem .
Ok , you &apos;re gonna have to not touch my ass .
Well , in <unk> of the yummy <unk> and <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve got pants that need to be altered .
Hey , Chandler , when you see Frankie , tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello .
He &apos;ll know what it means .
Are you sure he &apos;s gonna be able to crack that code ?
You know it &apos;s funny , the last time Paulo was here , my hair was so much shorter and cuter .
All right .
Ok , but , but !
You have to promise that you will not be all like <unk> and bossy and Monica about it .
I promise .
All right .
Now some of you are gonna get cut , and some of you aren &apos;t .
But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing .
All right , that &apos;s it , I quit .
What ?
I didn &apos;t say anything .
Yeah , but this isn &apos;t the face of a person who <unk> a person .
Ok , this is the face of a person who , you know , doesn &apos;t trust a person .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry , Phoebe .
It &apos;s just a little shorter than what we had discussed .
Would you relax ?
I know what I am doing .
This is how he wears it .
How who wears it ?
Demi Moore .
Demi Moore is not a he .
Well , he was a he in <unk> , and in Ten .
That &apos;s <unk> Moore .
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore .
Oh .
Oh !
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
Oh my God !

She &apos;s the actress that was in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> !
Oh , she &apos;s got gorgeous hair .
I know !
How long do you want the <unk> ?
At least as long as I have the pants .
I just got that .
Ok , now we &apos;ll do your inseam .
How is she ?
It &apos;s too soon to tell .
She &apos;s resting , which is a good sign .
How &apos;s the hair ?
I &apos;m not gonna lie to you , Ross , it doesn &apos;t look good .
I put a <unk> on one side , which seems to have stopped the <unk> .
Can we see her ?
Your hair looks too good , I think it would upset her .
Ross , why don &apos;t you come on in .
Yeah .
How &apos;re you doing ?
I &apos;m okay .
Ooh , that bad , huh ?
What ?
Look , I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable .
It &apos;s one of my <unk> .
When I saw him get off that plane with her , I really thought I hit rock bottom .
But today , it &apos;s like there &apos;s rock bottom , 50 feet of crap , then me .
You gotta tell Ross how you feel .
Come on .
How can I just tell him ?
What about Julie ?
What about her ?
They &apos;ve only been going out for two weeks .
Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
Look , Rach , Rach !
I &apos;ve been with my share of women .
In fact , I &apos;ve been with like a lot of people &apos;s share of women .
The point is , I &apos;ve never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you .
<unk> , <unk> !
Can I talk to you for a sec ?
Your tailor is a very bad man !
Frankie ?
What &apos;re you talking about ?
Hey , what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Joey &apos;s tailor ... took advantage of me .
What ?
No way .
I &apos;ve been going to the guy for 12 years .
Oh come on !
He said he was going to do my inseam , and he ran his hand up my leg , and then , there was <unk> ... What ?
<unk> .
That &apos;s how they do pants !
First they go up one side , they move it over , then they go up the other side , they move it back , and then they do the <unk> .
What ?
Ross , Ross , would you tell him ?
Isn &apos;t that how they measure pants ?
Yes , yes it is .
In prison !
<unk> matter with you ?
What ?
That &apos;s not ?
Oh my God .
Even Mary Tyler Moore would &apos;ve been better .
I like it .
I do , I think it &apos;s a Ten .
Thank you .
My hair is very <unk> .
Come on , Monica , things could be worse .
You could get caught between the moon and New York City .
I know it &apos;s crazy , but it &apos;s true .
Thank you .
Well , I gotta go .
Bye .
Bye , Rach .
Wait , are you leaving ?
Yeah , that &apos;s kinda what I meant by &quot; bye ! &quot;
Well , can I talk to you for a sec ?
Okay .
Hey , when the doctor does that <unk> test ... That &apos;s ok . What &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Well , first of all , Paulo and I are not back together .
It was just a stupid thing I did , and if I could go back in time and do it again , well , I wouldn &apos;t .
Um , second of all , what ?
Ok . Well , before I say anything , I just need to know , is this one of those things where you break up with a guy , and then I tell you what I think , and then the next day you get back together with the guy , and I look like a complete idiot ?
No .
No-no-no-no .
Well , then , I think , I think the guy is scum .
I hate him .
I mean I <unk> physically hate him .
I always have .
You are way too good to be with a guy like that .
Really ?
You deserve to be with someone who <unk> you , and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing , and adorable , and sexy you are , you know ?
Someone who <unk> up every morning thinking &quot; Oh my god , I &apos;m with Rachel &quot; .
You know , someone who makes you feel good , the way I am with Julie .
Was there a second of all ?
No , I think that was the whole all .
Okay .
Okay .
Okay .
I swear to god , Dad .
That &apos;s not how they measure pants .
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter , you know , like Andie McDowell &apos;s new haircut ?
Oh yeah !
Oh , I can do that .
Really ?
You wanna do it right now ?
Great !
Ok , I just wanna be really sure this time .
Andie McDowell &apos;s the girl from Four <unk> and a <unk> , right ?
No .
No no no no no .
That &apos;s <unk> McDowell .
Andie McDowell is the guy from <unk> of the <unk> .
Oh , yeah .
Ok , thank you .
You &apos;re welcome .
Ok , these were unbelievably expensive , and I know he &apos;s gonna grow out of them in like , 20 minutes , but I couldn &apos;t resist .
Oh , look at these !
Hey , Ben .
Just do it .
Oh my God , oh , ok , was that too much pressure for him ?
Oh , is he hungry already ?
I guess so .
You know , it &apos;s ... something funny about <unk> .

I gotta get one , too .
What are you guys doing ?
We &apos;re just hanging out by the <unk> .

Look , would you guys grow up ?
That is the most <unk> beautiful thing in the world .
Yeah , we know , but there &apos;s a baby <unk> &apos; on it .
This is my son having lunch , ok ?
It &apos;s gonna happen a lot , so you &apos;d better get used to it .
Now if you have any problem with it , if you &apos;re uncomfortable , just ask questions .
Carol &apos;s fine with it , now come on .
Carol ?

I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about <unk> ?
Sure .

It &apos;s breast milk .
So ?
Phoebe , that is juice , squeezed from a person .
What is the big deal ?
What did you just do ?
Ok , would people stop drinking the breast milk ?
You won &apos;t even taste it ?
No !
Not even if you just <unk> that it &apos;s milk ?
Not even if Carol &apos;s breast had a picture of a missing child on it .
Hey , where is everybody ?
They took Ben to the park .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Just out .
Had some lunch , just me , little quality time with me .

Oh , no problem .
You can borrow it , by the way .
Here are your keys , <unk> .
Okay .
Mon , if uh you were at lunch alone , how come it cost you uh <unk> dollars ?
You know what probably happened ?
Someone musta stolen my credit card .
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket ?
That is an excellent excellent question .
That is excellent .
Monica , what is with you ?
Who &apos;d you have lunch with ?
Judy .
Who ?

You were with Julie ?
Look , when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother &apos;s girlfriend .
And then , one thing <unk> to another and , before I knew it , we were ... shopping .
Oh .
Oh my God .
Honey , wait .
We only did it once .
It didn &apos;t mean anything to me .
Yeah , right .
Sure !
Really , Rachel , I was thinking of you the whole time .
Look , I &apos;m sorry , all right .
I never meant for you to find out !
Oh , please , you wanted to get caught .
That is not true !
Oh , so you just sort of happened to leave it in here ?
Did it ever <unk> to you that I might just be that stupid ?
Ok , Monica .
I just have to know one thing .
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale &apos;s ?
Oh !
Ok , ok , ok , I just really , uh , I just really need to not be with you right now .
Hi , who &apos;s this ?
Hi , Joanne .
Is Rachel working ?
It &apos;s Monica .
Yes , I know I did a horrible thing .
Joanne , it &apos;s not as <unk> as all that , ok ?
No , I don &apos;t care what Steve thinks .
Hi , Steve .
Hey !
How did we do ?
Oh , I tasted Ben &apos;s milk , and Ross freaked out .
I did not freak out .
Why &apos;d you freak out ?
Because it &apos;s breast milk .
It &apos;s gross .
My breast milk is gross ?
This should be fun .
No , no , Carol .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
I just , I just don &apos;t think breast milk is for adults .
Of course the <unk> does <unk> to grown-ups and kids <unk> .
Ross , you &apos;re being silly .
I &apos;ve tried it , it &apos;s no big deal .
Just taste it .
That would be no .
Come on .
It doesn &apos;t taste bad .
Yeah , it &apos;s kinda sweet , sorta like , uh ... <unk> juice .
Exactly .
You &apos;ve tasted it ?
You &apos;ve tasted it .
Uh huh .
Oh , you &apos;ve tasted it .
You can keep saying it , but it won &apos;t stop being true .
Gimme the bottle .
Gimme the towel .
<unk> .
Gimme a box a juice .
Well , they switched me over to Hombre .
Well , maybe it &apos;s because of the way you &apos;re dressed .
Or maybe it &apos;s because this guy &apos;s doing so good they wanna put more people on it .
You should see this guy , Chandler , he goes through two <unk> a day .
What do you care ?
You &apos;re an actor .
This is your day job .
This isn &apos;t supposed to mean anything to you .
I know , but , I was the best , you know ?
I liked being the best .
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I should just get outta the game .
They need guys up in <unk> to serve cheese .
All right , say you do that .
You know sooner or later somebody &apos;s gonna come along that <unk> a better <unk> .
And then where &apos;re you gonna run ?
Yeah I guess you &apos;re right .
You &apos;re damn right I &apos;m right .
I say you show this guy what you &apos;re made of .
I say you stand your <unk> .
I say you show him that you are the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m gonna do it .
All right .
Now go see Miss <unk> and she &apos;ll fix you up with a nice hooker .
I don &apos;t know what else to say .
Well that works out good , because I &apos;m not listening .
I feel terrible , I really do .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , did my back hurt your <unk> ?
Rachel , say that I &apos;m friends with her , we spend some time together .
Is that so terrible ?
Yes .
It &apos;s that terrible ?
Yes .
Monica , you don &apos;t get it .
It &apos;s bad enough that she &apos;s stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with , but now , she &apos;s actually , but now she &apos;s actually stealing you .
Me ?
What are you talking about ?
Nobody could steal me from you .
I mean , just because I &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .
I mean , you &apos;re my ... We &apos;re , we &apos;re ... Oh , I love you .
I love you too .
You guys , um I know that this really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with me , but um I love you guys too .
Oh , I really needed that .
Look , I know that you &apos;re in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie &apos;s guts , but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
I mean , she was just a girl who met a guy , and now they go out .
I really think that if you gave her a chance , you &apos;d like her .
Would you just give that a chance , for me ?
I &apos;d do anything for you , you know that .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
Wait , wait , wait , wait !
Mornin &apos; .
I said , <unk> &apos; .
I heard ya .
All right , everybody , I &apos;m <unk> &apos; the <unk> .
You boys ready ?
Ready .
Yeah , I &apos;m ready .
You idiot , you stupid cowboy , you <unk> me , I &apos;m <unk> !
Oh my god , <unk> !

I &apos;m sorry .
I am such a <unk> .
I &apos;m so sorry , I &apos;m so sorry .
My god , what happened ?
These new kids , they never last .
<unk> or later , they all ... stop <unk> &apos; .
Listen , uh , what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now ?
Sure .
So .
So .
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit .
I mean , you know , we &apos;ve never really talked .
I guess you &apos;d know that , being one of the two of us , though , right ?
I know , I probably shouldn &apos;t even tell you this , but I &apos;m pretty much totally intimidated by you .
Really ?
Me ?
Yes .
Oh my god , are you kidding ?
Ross is so crazy about you , and I really wanted you to like me , and , it &apos;s probably me being totally paranoid , but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don &apos;t .
Well , you &apos;re not totally paranoid .
<unk> .
Um , ok , uh , oh god , um , when you and uh Ross first started going out , it was really hard for me , um , for many reasons , which I &apos;m not gonna <unk> you with now , but um , I just , I see how happy he is , you know , and how good you guys are together , and um , Monica &apos;s always saying how nice you are , and god I hate it when she &apos;s right .
Thanks .
Hey , listen , would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?
Yeah , that &apos;d be great .
I &apos;d love it .
I &apos;d love it too .
Shoot , I gotta go .
So , I &apos;ll talk to you later .
All right , Julie .

I &apos;m tellin &apos; you , she <unk> back , I could see her brain .
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial <unk> things ?
Hold it hold it .
I gotta side with Chandler on this one .
When I first moved to the city , I went out a couple of times with this girl , really hot , great <unk> , but she had the biggest Adam &apos;s apple .
It made me nuts .
You or me ?
I got it .
Uh , Joey , women don &apos;t have Adam &apos;s apples .
