Y &apos;know , I &apos;ve done nothing but crappy plays for six years .
And I finally get my shot , and I blow it !
Maybe this wasn &apos;t your shot .
Yeah , I mean ...
I think when it &apos;s your shot , y &apos;know , you-you know it &apos;s your shot .
Did it ... feel like your shot .. ?
Hard to tell , I was naked .
No , I don &apos;t think this was your shot .
I mean , I don &apos;t even think you just get one shot .
I really believe big things are gonna happen for you , I do !
You &apos;ve gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go &apos; I got the part !
I got the part !
I &apos;m gonna be Joey Tribbiani &apos;s ass ! &apos; .
Yeah ?
That &apos;s so nice !
I &apos;m sorry , Joey .
I &apos;m gonna go to bed , guys .
Night .
Uh , Mon , you-you gonna leave your shoes out here ?
Uh-huh !
Really ?
Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner ?
Doesn &apos;t matter , I &apos;ll get &apos; em tomorrow .
Or not .
Whenever .
She is a kook .
If it bothers you that much , just go out and get the shoes .
No .
Don &apos;t do this .
This is stupid !
I don &apos;t have to prove anything , I &apos;m gonna go get them ... But then everyone will know .
Unless I get them , and then wake up really early and put them back !
... I need help !
Everybody ?
Shh , shhh .
Uhhh ... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay .
Hi .
Um , I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about .
OK , here we go .
OK , thank you very much .
Oh , great .
This is just ... Wow , this is so cool , you guys .
The entire city is blacked out !
Mom says it &apos;s all of Manhattan , parts of Brooklyn and Queens , and they have no idea when it &apos;s coming back on .
Wow , you guys , this is big .
Pants and a sweater ?
Why , mom ?
Who am I gonna meet in a blackout ?
Power company guys ?
Eligible looters ?
Could we talk about this later ?
OK . Can I borrow the phone ?
I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma .
What &apos;s my number ?
Well , I never call me .
Oh my God , it &apos;s that Victoria &apos;s Secret model .
Something ... something Goodacre .
Hi Mom , it &apos;s Jill .
She &apos;s right , it &apos;s Jill .
Jill Goodacre .
Oh my God .
I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre !
Is it a vestibule ?
Maybe it &apos;s an atrium .
Oh , yeah , that is the part to focus on , you idiot !
Yeah , I &apos;m fine .
I &apos;m just stuck at the bank , in an ATM vestibule .
Jill says vestibule ...
I &apos;m going with vestibule .
I &apos;m fine .
No , I &apos;m not alone ...
I don &apos;t know , some guy .
Oh !
Some guy .
Some guy .
&apos;Hey Jill , I saw you with some guy last night .
Yes , he was some guy .
Hi everyone .
And officiating at tonight &apos;s blackout , is Rabbi Tribbiani .
Well , Chandler &apos;s old roomate was Jewish , and these are the only candles we have , so ...
Happy Chanukah , everyone .
Eww , look .
Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles .
That had to hurt !
Alright , alright , alright .
It &apos;s been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word .
Oh God , do something .
Just make contact , smile !
There you go !
You &apos;re definitely scaring here .
Would you like to call somebody ?
Yeah , about 300 guys I went to high school with .
Yeah , thanks .
Hello ?
Hey , it &apos;s me .
It &apos;s Chandler !
Are you OK ?
Yeah , I &apos;m fine .
I &apos;m trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr .
What ?
I &apos;m trppd ... in an ATM vstbl ... wth Jll Gdcr !
I have no idea what you just said .
Put Joey on the phone .
What &apos;s up man ?
I &apos;m trppd ... in an ATM vstbl ... wth JLL GDCR .
Oh my God !
He &apos;s trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre !
Chandler , listen .
Yeah , like that thought never entered my mind .
Alright , somebody .
OK , I &apos;ll go .
OK , senior year of college ... on a pool table .
Whoooaa !
That &apos;s my sister .
OK ... my weirdest place would have to be ... the women &apos;s room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library .
Oh my God !
What were you doing in a library ?
Pheebs , what about you ?
Oh ... Milwaukee .
Um ... Ross ?
Disneyland , 1989 , &apos; It &apos;s a Small World After All . &apos;
No way !
The ride broke down .
So , Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children ... then they fixed the ride , and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom .
Oh , Rachel .
Oh come on , I already went .
You did not go !
Come on .
Oh , alright .
The weirdest place would have to be ... ... oh , the foot of the bed .
Step back .
We have a winner !
I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion , you know , where you have to have somebody right there , in the middle of a theme park .
Well , it was the only thing to do there that didn &apos;t have a line .
There , well , see ?
Barry wouldn &apos;t even kiss me on a miniature golf course .
Come on .
No , he said we were holding up the people behind us .
And you didn &apos;t marry him because ... ?
I mean , do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of ...
Probably .
But you know , I &apos;ll tell you something .
Passion is way overrated .
Yeah right .
It is .
Eventually , it kind of ... burns out .
But hopefully , what you &apos;re left with is trust , and security , and ... well , in the case of my ex-wife , lesbianism .
So , you know , for all of those people who miss out on that passion ... thing , there &apos;s all that other good stuff .
OK .
But , um ...
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to be you .
You don &apos;t .
Uh-uh .
See , I see .... big passion in your future .
Really ?
Mmmm .
You do ?
I do .
Oh Ross , you &apos;re so great .
It &apos;s never gonna happen .
What ?
You and Rachel .
What ?
Why not ?
Because you waited too long to make your move , and now you &apos;re in the friend zone .
No , no , no .
I &apos;m not in the zone .
Ross , you &apos;re mayor of the zone .
I &apos;m taking my time , alright ?
I &apos;m laying the groundwork .
Yeah .
I mean , every day I get just a little bit closer to ... Priesthood !
Look Ross , I &apos;m telling you , she has no idea what you &apos;re thinking .
If you don &apos;t ask her out soon you &apos;re going to end up stuck in the zone forever .
I will , I will .
See , I &apos;m waiting for the right moment .
What ?
What , now ?
Yeeeeaaaahhh !
What &apos;s messing you up ?
The wine ?
The candles ?
The moonlight ?
You &apos;ve just got to go up to her and say , &apos; Rachel , I think that ... &apos; Shhhh !
What are you shushing ?
We &apos;re shushing ... because ... we &apos;re trying to hear something .
Listen .
Don &apos;t you hear that ?
Ahhhh !
See ?
Huh .
Would you like some gum ?
Um , is it sugarless ?
Sorry , it &apos;s not .
Oh , then no thanks .
What the hell was that ?
Mental note : If Jill Goodacre offers you gum , you take it .
If she offers you mangled animal carcass , you take it .
New York City has no power , and the milk is getting sour .
But to me it is not scary , &apos; cause I stay away from dairy .... la la la , la la , la la ... OK , here goes .
Are you going to do it ?
I &apos;m going to do it .
Do you want any help ?
You come out there , you &apos;re a dead man .
Good luck , man .
Thanks .
OK . OK . Hey , where are you going ?
Outside .
You can &apos;t go out there .
Why not ?
Because of ... the reason .
And that would be ?
I , um , can &apos;t tell you .
Joey , what &apos;s going on ?
OK , you &apos;ve got to promise that you &apos;ll never , ever tell Ross that I told you .
About what ?
He &apos;s planning your birthday party .
Oh my God !
I love him !
You &apos;d better act surprised .
About what ?
My surprise party !
What surprise party ?
Oh stop it .
Joey already told me .
Well , he didn &apos;t tell me .
Hey , don &apos;t look at me .
This is Ross &apos;s thing .
This is so typical .
I &apos;m always the last one to know everything .
No , you are not .
We tell you stuff .
Yuh-huh !
I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo .
I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in .
Looks like I was second to last .
Hmmm ... this is so nice .
OK , I have a question .
Well , actually , it &apos;s not so much a question as .. more of a general wondering ... ment .
OK . OK .
Here goes .
For a while now , I &apos;ve been wanting to , um ....
Ohhh ! ! ! !
Yes , yes , that &apos;s right ... Oh , look at the little cat !
What ?
Ow !
I &apos;m on top of the world , looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find , is the wonders I &apos;ve found ever since ...
This is just Bactine .
It won &apos;t hurt .
Sorry , that was wax .
Oh , poor little Tooty is scared to death .
We should find his owner .
Why don &apos;t we just put &apos; poor little Tooty &apos; out in the hall ?
During a blackout ?
He &apos;d get trampled !
Yeah ?
You know , on second thought , gum would be perfection .
&apos;Gum would be perfection &apos; ?
&apos;Gum would be perfection . &apos;
Could have said &apos; gum would be nice , &apos; or &apos; I &apos;ll have a stick , &apos; but no , no , no , no .
For me , gum is perfection .
I loathe myself .
Oh no , the Mendels , they hate all living things , right ?
Oh .
Hi .
We just found this cat and we &apos;re looking for the owner .
Er , yeah , it &apos;s mine .
He seems to hate you .
Are you sure ?
Yeah , it &apos;s my cat .
Give me my cat .
Wait a minute .
What &apos;s his name ?
Ehhhh ... B-Buttons .
Bob Buttons ?
Mmm .
Bob Buttons .
Here , Bob Buttons .
Oooh !
You are a very bad man !
You owe me a cat .
Here , kitty-kitty .
Here kitty-kitty .
Where did you go , little kitty-kitty-kitty ?
Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty ... Wow .
Lucky sixes .... Everybody , this is Paolo .
Paolo , I want you to meet my friends .
This is Monica .
Hi !
And Joey .... Hi !
And Ross .
Hi !
He doesn &apos;t speak much English .
Monopoly !
Look at that !
So , um ... where did Paolo come from ?
Oh ... Italy , I think .
No , I mean tonight , in the building .
Suddenly .
Into our lives .
Well , the cat ... the cat turned out to be Paolo &apos;s cat !
That , that is funny ... .... and Rachel keeps touching him .
Alright .
I looked all over the building and I couldn &apos;t find the kitty anywhere .
Oh , I found him .
He was Paolo &apos;s cat .
Ah !
Well !
There you go !
Last to know again !
And I &apos;m guessing ... since nobody told me ... this is Paolo .
Ah , Paolo , this is Phoebe .
You betcha !
Ah , let &apos;s see .
What next ?
Blow a bubble .
A bubble &apos;s good .
It &apos;s got a ... boyish charm , it &apos;s impish .
Here we go .
Nice going , imp .
OK , it &apos;s OK . All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth .
Good save !
We &apos;re back on track , and I &apos;m ... .. chewing someone else &apos;s gum .
This is not my gum .
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
And now you &apos;re choking .
Are you alright ?
My God , you &apos;re choking !
That better ?
Yes ... thank you .
That was ... that was ....
Perfection ?
Blah blah blah , blah blah blah ... blah blaaaaaah .... Wha-What did he say that was so funny ?
I have absolutely no idea .
That &apos;s ... that &apos;s classic .
Oh my God , you guys , what am I doing ?
What am I doing ?
This is so un-me !
If you want , I &apos;ll do it .
I know , I just want to bite his bottom lip .
But I won &apos;t .
God , the first time he smiled at me ... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry .
You know , did you ride mopeds ?
&apos;Cause I &apos;ve heard ... ... oh , I see ... it &apos;s not about that right now .
OK . Y &apos;know , I know it &apos;s totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common , and we don &apos;t even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd .... Paolo .
Hi .
Ross !
Listen .
Um , listen .
Something you should ... know ... um , Rachel and I ... we &apos;re kind of a thing .
Thing ?
Thing , yes .
Thing .
Ah , you ... have the sex ?
No , no , no .
Technically the ... sex is not ... being had , but that &apos;s ... see , that &apos;s not the point .
See , um , the point is that ... Rachel and I should be , er , together .
You know , and if you get in the .... um ...
Bed ?
No , no , that &apos;s not where I was going .
Er , if you get in the ... way , of us becoming a thing , then I would be , well , very sad .
Oh !
Yeah !
Se vice ?
Si .
So you do know a little English .
Poco ... a leetle .
Do you know the word crapweasel ?
No .
That &apos;s funny , because you know , you are a huge crapweasel !
Chandler , we &apos;ve been here for an hour doing this !
Now watch , it &apos;s easy .
OK . Ready ?
No , you &apos;ve got to whip it .
Oh , look look look .
The last candle &apos;s about to burn out .
10 , 9 , 8 , 7 ... ... negative 46 , negative 47 , negative 48 ....
Thank you .
Thanks .
Kinda ... spooky without any lights .
Bwah-hah-hah !
OK , guys , guys ?
I have the definitive one .
Mwwwooooo-hah-hah ... Oh .. oh ... oh .
Hey Ross .
This probably isn &apos;t the best time to bring it up , but you have to throw a party for Monica .
Well , this has been fun .
Yes .
Yes , thanks for letting me use your phone ... and for saving my life .
Well , goodbye Chandler .
I had a great blackout .
See ya .
Hi , um , I &apos;m account number 7143457 .
And , uh , I don &apos;t know if you got any of that , but I would really like a copy of the tape .
Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights ... does it get better than this ?
Question .
You &apos;re not dating anybody , are you , because I met somebody who would be perfect for you .
Ah , y &apos;see , perfect might be a problem .
Had you said &apos; co-dependent &apos; , or &apos; self-destructive &apos; ... Do you want a date Saturday ?
Yes please .
Okay .
He &apos;s cute , he &apos;s funny , he &apos;s- He &apos;s a he ?
Well yeah !
... Oh God .
I- just- I thought- Good , Shelley .
I &apos;m just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now ...
Okay , goodbye ... ... Couldn &apos;t enjoy a cup of noodles after that .
I mean , is that ridiculous ?
Can you believe she actually thought that ?
Um ... yeah .
Well , I mean , when I first met you , y &apos;know , I thought maybe , possibly , you might be ... You did ?
Yeah , but then you spent Phoebe &apos;s entire birthday party talking to my breasts , so then I figured maybe not .
Huh .
Did , uh ... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me ?
I did .
Yeah , I think so , yeah .
Not me .
Nono , me neither .
Although , uh , y &apos;know , back in college , Susan Sallidor did .
You &apos;re kidding !
Did you tell her I wasn &apos;t ?
No .
No , it &apos;s just &apos; cause , uh , I kinda wanted to go out with her too , so I told her , actually , you were seeing Bernie Spellman ... who also liked her , so ... Well , this is fascinating .
So , uh , what is it about me ?
I dunno , &apos; cause you &apos;re smart , you &apos;re funny ... Ross is smart and funny , d &apos;you ever think that about him ?
Yeah !
Right !
WHAT IS IT ? !
Okay , I-I d &apos;know , you-you just- you have a quality .
Yes .
Absolutely .
A quality .
Oh , oh , a quality , good , because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Oh !
Rachel , it &apos;s Paolo calling from Rome .
Oh my God !
Calling from Rome !
Bon giorno , caro mio .
So he &apos;s calling from Rome .
I could do that .
Just gotta go to Rome .
Monica , your dad just beeped in , but can you make it quick ?
Talking to Rome .
I &apos;m talking to Rome .
Hey dad , what &apos;s up ?
Oh God .
Ross , it &apos;s Nana .
So , uh , how &apos;s she doing ?
The doctor says it &apos;s a matter of hours .
How-how are you , Mom ?
Me ?
I &apos;m fine , fine .
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
... What &apos;s with your hair ?
What ?
What &apos;s different ?
Nothing .
Oh , maybe that &apos;s it .
She is unbelievable , our mother is ...
Okay , relax , relax .
We are gonna be here for a while , it looks like , and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover .
Oh God !
The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse .
Oh !
... Yeah , they were gross .
Oh , you know what I loved ?
Her Sweet &apos; n &apos; Los .
How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants .
Not just restaurants , from our house .
Mrs. Geller ?
She looks so small .
I know .
Well , at least she &apos;s with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now .
G &apos;bye , Nana .
Bye , Nana .
Ross !
What is going on ? !
Y &apos;know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed ?
Well , she &apos;s not , quite .. What ?
She &apos;s not- past , she &apos;s present , she &apos;s back .
What &apos;s going on ?
She may have died .
She may have died ?
We &apos;re looking into it .
I , uh , I &apos;ll go see .
This almost never happens !
Now she &apos;s passed .
I just have to know , okay .
Is it my hair ?
Yes , Chandler , that &apos;s exactly what it is .
It &apos;s your hair .
Yeah , you have homosexual hair .
So , um , did she ... Twice .
Twice ?
Oh , that sucks !
You guys okay ?
I dunno , it &apos;s weird .
I mean , I know she &apos;s gone , but I just don &apos;t feel , uh ... Maybe that &apos;s &apos; cause she &apos;s not really gone .
Nono , she &apos;s gone .
We checked .
A lot .
Hm , I mean maybe no-one ever really goes .
Ever since my mom died , every now and then , I get the feeling that she &apos;s like right here , y &apos;know ?
Oh !
And Debbie , my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils , y &apos;know ?
... I miss her .
Aw .
Hey , Pheebs , want this ?
Thanks !
Sure .
I just sharpened her this morning .
Now , see , I don &apos;t believe any of that .
I think once you &apos;re dead , you &apos;re dead !
You &apos;re gone !
You &apos;re worm food !
... So Chandler looks gay , huh ?
Y &apos;know , I dunno who this is , but it &apos;s not Debbie .
I thought it was gonna be a closed casket .
Well , that doesn &apos;t mean she can &apos;t look nice !
Sweetie , you think you can get in there ?
I don &apos;t see why not .
Here &apos;s my retainer !
I was just thinking .
When my time comes- Dad !
Listen to me !
When my time comes , I wanna be buried at sea .
You what ?
I wanna be buried at sea , it looks like fun .
Define fun .
C &apos;mon , you &apos;ll make a day of it !
You &apos;ll rent a boat , pack a lunch ... ... And then we throw your body in the water ... Gee , that does sound fun .
Everyone thinks they know me .
Everyone says &apos; Jack Geller , so predictable &apos; .
Maybe after I &apos;m gone , they &apos;ll say &apos; Buried at sea !
Huh ! &apos; .
That &apos;s probably what they &apos;ll say .
I &apos;d like that .
Hey , gorgeous .
Hey .
Look , I &apos;m sorry about yesterday , I , um- No , nono , don &apos;t- don &apos;t worry about it .
Believe me , apparently other people have made the same mistake .
Oh !
Okay !
Phew !
So , uh ... what do you think it is about me ?
I dunno , uh ... you just have a-a ... ... Quality , right , great .
Y &apos;know , it &apos;s a shame , because you and Lowell would &apos;ve made a great couple .
Lowell ?
Financial Services &apos; Lowell , that &apos;s who you saw me with ?
What ?
He &apos;s cute !
Well , yeah ... &apos; s &apos;no Brian in Payroll .
Is Brian ... ?
No !
Uh , I d &apos;know !
The point is , if you were gonna set me up with someone , I &apos;d like to think you &apos;d set me up with someone like him .
Well , I think Brian &apos;s a little out of your league .
Excuse me ?
You don &apos;t think I could get a Brian ?
Because I could get a Brian .
Believe you me .
... I &apos;m really not .
This one ?
No .
I have shown you everything we have .
Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit , go with the burgundy .
You know , whatever we pick , she would &apos;ve told us it &apos;s the wrong one .
You &apos;re right .
We &apos;ll go with the burgundy .
Oh !
A fine choice .
I &apos;m coming out .
Wait !
We need shoes !
Okay .
Um , how about these ?
That &apos;s really a day shoe .
And where she &apos;s going everyone else &apos;ll be dressier ?
Could we see something in a slimmer heel ?
Okay , I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy .
I can show you something in a silver that may work .
No , it really should be burgundy .
Mm .
Unless we go with a different dress ?
No !
Nonono , wait a sec .
I may have something in the back .
Oh my God .. Is everything all right , dear ?
Yeah , just ... just Nana stuff .
How we doing , you guys ready ?
Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up .
Did you know my ears are not my best feature ?
Some days it &apos;s all I can think about .
Hi , sorry I &apos;m late , I couldn &apos;t find my bearings .
Oh , you-you mean your earrings ?
What &apos;d I say ?
Hm-m . Are these the shoes ?
Yes .
Paolo sent them from Italy .
What , we-uh- we don &apos;t have shoes here , or ... ?
Morning .
We ready to go ?
Well , don &apos;t we look nice all dressed up ? ... It &apos;s stuff like that , isn &apos;t it ?
It was a really beautiful service .
It really was .
Oh , c &apos;mere , sweetheart .
Y &apos;know , I think it might be time for you to start using night cream .
What ?
Nothing , just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger .
Check it out , Giants-Cowboys .
You &apos;re watching a football game at a funeral ?
No , it &apos;s the pre-game .
I &apos;m gonna watch it at the reception .
You are a frightening , frightening man .
Oh no !
My new Paolo shoes !
Oh , I hope they &apos;re not ruined .
God , what a great day .
... What ?
Weather-wise !
I know , uh , the air , the-the trees ... even though Nana &apos;s gone there &apos;s , there &apos;s something almost , uh- I dunno , almost life-aff- God !
Ross !
I &apos;m fine .
Just-just ... having my worst fear realised ...
Okay , don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m just checking to see if the muscle &apos;s in spasm ... huh .
What , what is it ?
You missed a belt loop .
Oh !
No-n- Okay , it &apos;s in spasm .
Here , sweetie , here .
I took these when I had my golfing accident .
Oh , no- Sorry- Hi , I &apos;m Dorothy &apos;s daughter .
Hi , I &apos;m Chandler , and I have no idea who Dorothy is .
Hey , look who &apos;s up !
How do you feel ?
I feel great .
I feel- great , I fleel great .
Wow , those pills really worked , huh ?
Not the first two , but the second two- woooo !
... I love you guys .
You guys are the greatest .
I love my sister , I love Pheebs ... Ooh !
That &apos;s so nice ... ... Chandler !
Hey .
And listen , man , if you wanna be gay , be gay .
Doesn &apos;t matter to me .
You were right .
Rachel .
Rachel Rachel .
I love you the most .
Oh , well you know who I love the most ?
No .
You !
Oh .. you don &apos;t get it !
Whaddya got there ?
Just a , uh ... hearing disability .
What &apos;s the score ?
Seventeen-fourteen Giants ... three minutes to go in the third .
Beautiful !
Pheebs , could you maybe hand me a cracker ?
Your grandmother would have hated this .
Well , sure , what with it being her funeral and all .
No , I &apos;d be hearing about &apos; Why didn &apos;t I get the honey-glazed ham ?
&apos; , I didn &apos;t spend enough on flowers , and if I spent more she &apos;d be saying &apos; Why are you wasting your money ?
I don &apos;t need flowers , I &apos;m dead &apos; .
That sounds like Nana .
Do you know what it &apos;s like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say ?
... I can imagine .
I &apos;m telling you , it &apos;s a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive , life-affirming person that she is .
That is a wonder .
So tell me something , Mom .
If you had to do it all over again , I mean , if she was here right now , would you tell her ?
Tell her what ?
How she drove you crazy , picking on every little detail , like your hair ... for example .
I &apos;m not sure I know what you &apos;re getting at .
Do you think things would have been better if you &apos;d just told her the truth ?
... No .
I think some things are better left unsaid .
I think it &apos;s nicer when people just get along .
Huh .
More wine , dear ?
Oh , I think so .
Those earrings look really lovely on you .
Thank you .
They &apos;re yours .
Actually they were Nana &apos;s .
Now I &apos;m depressed !
...
Even more than I was .
Hey , who &apos;s this little naked guy ?
That little naked guy would be me .
Aww , look at the little thing .
Yes , yes , fine , that is my penis .
Can we be grown-ups now ?
Who are those people ?
Got me .
Oh , that &apos;s Nana , right there in the middle .
&apos;Me and the gang at Java Joe &apos;s &apos; .
Wow , Monica , you look just like your grandmother .
How old was she there ?
Let &apos;s see , 1939 ... yeah , 24 , 25 ?
Looks like a fun gang .
Ooh , look-look-look-look-look !
I got Monica naked !
Nono , that would be me again .
I &apos;m , uh , just trying something .
Hey , Lowell .
Hey , Chandler .
So how &apos;s it going there in Financial Services ?
It &apos;s like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads .
How &apos; bout you ?
Good , good .
Listen , heh , I dunno what Shelley told you about me , but , uh ...
I &apos;m not .
I know .
That &apos;s what I told her .
Really .
Yeah .
So- you can tell ?
Pretty much , most of the time .
We have a kind of ... radar .
So you don &apos;t think I have a , a quality ?
Speaking for my people , I &apos;d have to say no .
By the way , your friend Brian from Payroll , he is .
He is ?
Yup , and waaay out of your league .
Out of my league .
I could get a Brian .
If I wanted to get a Brian , I could get a Brian .
Hey , Brian .
Terry , I , I , I know that I haven &apos;t worked here very long , but I was wondering , do you think it would be possible if I got a $ 100 advance in my salary ?
An advance ?
It &apos;s so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family .
See , every year we go skiing in Vail , and normally my father pays for my ticket , but I sort of started the whole independence thing , you know , which is actually why I took this job .
Rachel , Rachel , sweetheart .
You &apos;re a terrible , terrible waitress .
Really , really awful .
Ok , I , I hear what you &apos;re sayin &apos; .
I &apos;m with you .
Um , but I , but I &apos;m trying really hard .
And I think I &apos;m doing better .
I really do .
Does anybody need coffee ?
Oh , look at that .
Excuse me , sir .
Hi , you come in here all time .
I was just wondering , do you think there &apos;s a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips ?
Huh ?
Ok , ok , that &apos;s fine .
Fine .
Hey , I &apos;m sorry about that spill before .
Only $ 98.50 to go .
Hey .
Ross , did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving ?
No , they &apos;re not .
Yes , they are .
The Blymens invited them .
You &apos;re wrong .
I am not wrong .
You &apos;re wrong .
No , I just talked to them .
I &apos;m calling Mom .
Hey , hey .
Hey .
Hey .
And this from the cry-for-help department .
Are you wearing makeup ?
Yes , I am .
As of today , I am officially Joey Tribbiani , actor slash model .
That &apos;s so funny , &apos; cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani , man slash woman .
What were you modeling for ?
You know those posters for the city free clinic ?
Oh , wow , so you &apos;re gonna be one of those &quot; healthy , healthy , healthy guys &quot; ?
You know , the asthma guy was really cute .
Do you know which one you &apos;re gonna be ?
No , but I hear lyme disease is open , so ... Good luck , man .
I hope you get it .
Thanks .
Well , you were right .
How can they do this to us , huh ?
It &apos;s Thanksgiving .
Ok , I &apos;ll tell you what .
How about I cook dinner at my place ?
I &apos;ll make it just like Mom &apos;s .
Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps ?
You know , they &apos;re not actually supposed to have ...
I &apos;ll work on the lumps .
Joey , you &apos;re going home , right ?
Yeah .
And I assume , Chandler , you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays .
Yes , every single one of them .
Phoebe , you &apos;re gonna be with your grandma ?
Yes , and her boyfriend .
But we &apos;re celebrating Thanksgiving in December &apos; cause he is lunar .
So you &apos;re free Thursday , then .
Yeah .
Oh , can I come ?
Yeah .
Rach , are you thinking you &apos;re gonna make it to Vail ?
Absolutely .
Shoop , shoop , shoop .
Only a hundred and two dollars to go .
I thought it was $ 98.50 .
Yeah , well it was .
I , I broke a cup .
Well , I &apos;m off to Carol &apos;s .
Ooh , ooh !
Why don &apos;t we invite her ?
Ooh , ooh .
Because she &apos;s my ex-wife , and will probably want to bring her , ooh , ooh , lesbian life partner .
Hi , is uh , is Carol here ?
No , she &apos;s at a faculty meeting .
Oh , I uh , just came by to pick up my skull .
Well , not mine , but ... Susan : Come in .
Thanks .
Yeah , Carol borrowed it for a class , and I have to get it back to the museum .
What &apos;s it look like ?
Kinda like a big face without skin .
Yes , I &apos;m familiar with the concept .
We can just look for it .
Ok . Wow , you guys sure have a lot of books about bein &apos; a lesbian .
Well , you know , you have to take a course .
Otherwise , they don &apos;t let you do it .
Hey , hey , Yertle the Turtle .
A classic .
Actually , I &apos;m reading it to the baby .
The uh , the baby that hasn &apos;t been born yet ?
Wouldn &apos;t that mean you &apos;re ... crazy ?
What , you don &apos;t think they can hear sounds in there ?
You &apos;re not serious , I mean , you really ... you really talk to it ?
Yeah , all the time .
I want the baby to know my voice .
Do you uh , do you talk about me ?
Yeah , yeah , all the time .
Really ?
But um , we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy .
Look , if she &apos;s talking to it , I just think that I should get some belly time too .
Not that I believe any of this .
Oh , I believe it .
I think the baby can totally hear everything .
I can show you .
Look , this will seem a little weird , but you put your head inside this turkey , and then we &apos;ll all talk , and you &apos;ll hear everything we say .
I &apos;d just like to say that I &apos;m totally behind this experiment .
In fact , I &apos;d very much like to butter your head .
Hey , Rach , did you make your money ?
No , not even close .
Forget Vail , forget seeing my family , forget shoop , shoop , shoop .
Rach , here &apos;s your mail .
Thanks , you can just put it on the table .
No , here &apos;s your mail .
Thanks , you can just put it on the table .
Would you just open it ?
Oh my god , oh , you guys are great .
We all chipped in .
We did ?
You owe me 20 bucks .
Thank you .
Thank you so much !
Chandler , here you go , got your traditional Thanksgiving feast , you got your tomato soup , your grilled cheese fixin &apos;s , and your family size bag of Funyuns .
Wait , wait , Chandler , this is what you &apos;re havin &apos; for Thanksgiving dinner ?
What , what , what is it with you and this holiday ?
All right , I &apos;m nine years old .
Oh , I hate this story .
We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner .
I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie , and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they &apos;re getting divorced .
Oh my god .
Yes .
It &apos;s very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you &apos;ve seen it in reverse .
Uh , hi .
We uh , we used to work together .
We did ?
Yeah , at Macy &apos;s .
You were the Obsession girl , right ?
I was the Aramis guy .
Aramis ?
Aramis ?
Yeah , right .
I gotta tell you .
You &apos;re the best in the business .
Get out .
I &apos;m serious .
You &apos;re amazing .
You know when to spritz , when to lay back .
Really ?
You don &apos;t know what that means to me .
Ooh , you smell great tonight .
What &apos;re you wearing ?
Nothing .
Listen , uh , you wanna go get a drink or something ?
Yeah .
Oh .
What &apos;s wrong ?
I just remembered , I have to do something .
Oh .
What ?
Um , leave .
Wait , wait , wait !
So I guess you all saw it .
Saw what ?
No , we were just laughing .
You know , how laughter can be infectious .
Set another place for Thanksgiving .
My entire family thinks I have VD .
Tonight , on a very special Blossom .
Mmm , looking good .
Ok , cider &apos;s mulling , turkey &apos;s turking , yams are yamming .
What ?
I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s just not the same without Mom in the kitchen .
All right , that &apos;s it .
You know what ?
Just get out of my way and stop moping .
That &apos;s closer .
I got the tickets !
I got the tickets !
Five hours from now , shoop , shoop , shoop .
Oh , you must stop shooping .
Ok , I &apos;m gonna get my stuff .
Chandler , will you just come in already ?
No , I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment .
Look out , incoming pumpkin pie !
Ok , we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing , but that &apos;s not funny anymore .
Hey , Monica , I got a question .
I don &apos;t see any tater tots .
That &apos;s not a question .
But my mom always makes them .
It &apos;s like a tradition .
You get a little piece of turkey on your fork , a little cranberry sauce , and a tot !
It &apos;s bad enough I can &apos;t be with my family because of my disease .
All right , fine .
Tonight &apos;s potatoes will be both mashed with lumps , and in the form of tots .
Ok , I &apos;m off to talk to my unborn child .
Ah !
Ok , Mom never hit .
Ok , all done .
What , Phoebe , did you whip the potatoes ?
Ross needs lumps !
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , oh , I just , I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .
Why would we do that ?
Well , &apos; cause then they &apos;d be like my mom used to make them , you know , before she died .
Ok , three kinds of potatoes coming up .
Ok , good-bye you guys .
Thanks for everything .
Oh , sorry !
Oh , sorry !
The most unbelievable thing has happened .
Underdog has just gotten away .
The balloon ?
No , no , the actual cartoon character .
Of course the balloon .
It &apos;s all over the news .
Right before he reached Macy &apos;s , he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park .
I &apos;m goin &apos; to the roof , who &apos;s with me ?
I can &apos;t , I gotta go .
Come on .
An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city .
How often does that happen ?
Almost never .
Got the keys ?
or Got the keys !
Ok .
Anytime you &apos;re ready .
Ok , ok , here we go .
Ok , where am I talking to , here ?
I mean , uh , well , there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage , but ... Just aim for the bump .
Ok , ok , ok , ok , here goes .
You know , I , you know , can &apos;t do this .
Uh , this is too weird .
I feel stupid .
So don &apos;t do it , it &apos;s fine .
You don &apos;t have to do it just because Susan does it .
Hello , baby .
Hello , hello .
I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park .
Yeah , but did they have to shoot him down ?
I mean , that was just mean .
Ok , right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside , juicy on the inside .
Why are we standing here ?
We &apos;re waiting for you to open the door .
You got the keys .
No I don &apos;t .
Yes , you do .
When we left , you said , &quot; got the keys . &quot;
No I didn &apos;t .
I asked , &quot; got the ke-eys ? &quot;
No , no , no , you said , &quot; got the keys &quot; .
Do either of you have the keys ?
The oven is on .
Oh , I gotta get my ticket !
Wait , wait , we have a copy of your key .
Well then get it , get it !
That tone will not make me go any faster .
Joey !
That one will .
And everyone &apos;s telling me , you gotta pick a major , you gotta pick a major .
So , on a dare , I picked paleontology .
And you have no idea what I &apos;m saying , because , let &apos;s face it , you &apos;re a fetus .
You &apos;re just happy you don &apos;t have gills anymore .
Look , you don &apos;t have to talk to it .
You can sing to it if you want .
Oh , please .
I am not singing to your stomach , ok ?
Hi , how &apos;s it goin ?
Shh !
Here we come , walkin &apos; down the street , get the funniest looks from , everyone we meet .
Hey , hey !
Hey , uh , did you just feel that ?
I did .
Does it always , uh-- ?
No , no that was the first .
Keep singing !
Keep singing !
Hey , hey , you &apos;re my baby , and I can &apos;t wait to meet you .
When you come out I &apos;ll buy you a bagel , and then we &apos;ll go to the zoo .
I felt it !
Hey , hey , I &apos;m your daddy .
I &apos;m the one without any breasts .
Nope , not that one .
Can you go any faster with that ?
Hey , I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys .
You do the math .
Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway ?
For an emergency just like this .
All right , listen , smirky .
If it wasn &apos;t for you and your stupid balloon , I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now .
But I &apos;m not .
I swear you said you had the keys .
No , I didn &apos;t .
I wouldn &apos;t say I had the keys unless I had the keys , and I obviously didn &apos;t have the keys .
Ooh , ok , that &apos;s it .
Enough with the keys .
No one say keys .
Why would I have the keys ?
Aside from the fact that you said you had them ?
But I didn &apos;t .
Well , you should have .
Why ?
Because !
Why ?
Because !
Why ?
Because everything is my responsibility ?
Isn &apos;t it enough that I &apos;m making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone ?
You know , everyone wants a different kind of potatoes , so I &apos;m making different kinds of potatoes .
Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want ?
Nooooo , no , no !
Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions , and Mario gets his tots , and it &apos;s my first Thanksgiving , and it &apos;s all burned , and , and I ...
I ... Ok , Monica , only dogs can hear you now , so , look , the door &apos;s open .
Here we go .
Well , the turkey &apos;s burnt .
Potatoes are ruined , potatoes are ruined , potatoes are ruined .
Here we come , walkin &apos; down thethis doesn &apos;t smell like Mom &apos;s .
No , it doesn &apos;t , does it ?
But you wanted lumps , Ross ?
Well , here you go , buddy , ya got one .
Oh , god , this is great !
The plane is gone , so it looks like I &apos;m stuck here with you guys .
Hey , we all had better plans .
This was nobody &apos;s first choice .
Oh , really ?
So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner ?
You call that delicious ?
Stop it , stop it , stop it !
Now this feels like Thanksgiving .
Ooh .
What ?
Ugly Naked Guy &apos;s taking his turkey out of the oven .
Oh my god .
He &apos;s not alone .
Ugly Naked Guy &apos;s having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal .
I &apos;ve gotta see this .
All right Ugly Naked Guy !
Ooh , Ugly Naked Dancing !
It &apos;s nice that he has someone .
Shall I carve ?
By all means .
Ok , who wants light cheese , and who wants dark cheese ?
I don &apos;t even wanna know about the dark cheese .
Does anybody wanna split this with me ?
Oh , I will .
Ooh , you guys have to make a wish .
Make a wish ?
Come on , you know , Thanksgiving .
Ooh , you got the bigger half .
What &apos;d you wish for ?
The bigger half .
I &apos;d like to propose a toast .
Little toast here , ding ding .
I know this isn &apos;t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned , but for me , this has been really great , you know , I think because it didn &apos;t involve divorce or projectile vomiting .
Anyway , I was just thinking , I mean , if you &apos;d gone to Vail , and if you guys &apos;d been with your family , if you didn &apos;t have syphilis and stuff , we wouldn &apos;t be all together , you know ?
So I guess what I &apos;m trying to say is that I &apos;m very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked .
That &apos;s so sweet .
And hey , here &apos;s to a lousy Christmas .
And a crappy New Year .
Here , here !
Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids ?
Winner of 3 Tony Awards ...
He &apos;s finally happy with that and walks away .
Guys ?
There &apos;s a somebody I &apos;d like you to meet .
Oooh !
W-wait .
What is that ?
&apos;That &apos; would be Marcel .
You wanna say hi ?
No , no , I don &apos;t .
Oh , he is precious !
Where did you get him ?
My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab .
That is so cruel !
Why ?
Why would a parent name their child Bethel ?
Hey , that monkey &apos;s got a Ross on its ass !
Ross , is he gonna live with you , like , in your apartment ?
Yeah .
I mean , it &apos;s been kinda quiet since Carol left , so ... Why don &apos;t you just get a roommate ?
Nah , I dunno ...
I think you reach a certain age , having a roommate is kinda pathe- .... sorry , that &apos;s , that &apos;s &apos; pathet &apos; , which is Sanskrit for &apos; really cool way to live &apos; .
So you guys , I &apos;m doing all new material tonight .
I have twelve new songs about my mother &apos;s suicide , and one about a snowman .
Might wanna open with the snowman .
Hey , Joey .
Hey , buddy .
So , how &apos;d it go ?
Ahhhhhh , I didn &apos;t get the job .
How could you not get it ?
You were Santa last year .
I dunno .
Some fat guy &apos;s sleeping with the store manager .
He &apos;s not even jolly , it &apos;s all political .
So what are you gonna be ?
Ah , I &apos;m gonna be one of his helpers .
It &apos;s just such a slap in the face , y &apos;know ?
Hey , do you guys know what you &apos;re doing for New Year &apos;s ?
Gee , what ? !
What is wrong with New Year &apos;s ?
Nothing for you , you have Paolo .
You don &apos;t have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday : desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops ! !
Man , I &apos;m talking loud !
Well , for your information , Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year , so I &apos;ll be just as pathetic as the rest of you .
Yeah , you wish !
It &apos;s just that I &apos;m sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday .
I say this year , no dates , we make a pact .
Just the six of us- dinner .
Yeah , okay .
Alright .
Y &apos;know , I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm .
Woooo !
Yeah !
Phoebe , you &apos;re on .
Oh , oh , good .
Okay , hi .
Ladies and gentlemen , back by popular demand , Miss Phoebe Buffay .
Wooh !
Thanks , hi .
Um , I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year .
I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin &apos; , How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen ?
La lalala la la la la lalala la la ... ... My mother &apos;s ashes Even her eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar , And sometimes when it &apos;s breezy ...
... I feel a little sneezy And now I- Excuse me , excuse me !
Yeah , noisy boys !
Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group ?
No .
No , that &apos;s- that &apos;s okay .
Well , c &apos;mon , if it &apos;s important enough to discuss while I &apos;m playing , then I assume it &apos;s important enough for everyone else to hear !
That guy &apos;s going home with a note !
Noth- I was- I was just saying to my- Could you speak up please ?
Sorry , I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I &apos;d ever seen in my- in my life .
And then he said that- you said you thought Daryl Hannah .
Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he &apos;d ever seen in his life and I said yeah , I liked her in Splash , a lot , but not so much in- in Wall Street , I thought she had kind of a Hard quality .
-hard quality .
And uh , while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way , you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace .
Then , uh , that-that-that &apos;s when you started yelling .
Okay , we &apos;re gonna take a short break .
Hey , that guy &apos;s going home with more than a note !
Come here , Marcel .
Sit here .
Pheebs , I can &apos;t believe he hasn &apos;t kissed you yet .
I mean God , by my sixth date with Paolo , I mean he had already named both my breasts !
... Ooh .
Did I just share too much ?
Just a smidge .
David &apos;s like , y &apos;know , Scientist Guy .
He &apos;s very methodical .
I think it &apos;s romantic .
Me too !
Oh !
Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman ?
Yeah !
Well , he &apos;s kinda like the guy I went to see that with .
Except , except he-he &apos;s smarter , and gentler , and sweeter ...
I just- I just wanna be with him all the time .
Day and night , and night and day ... and special occasions ...
Wait a minute , wait a minute , I see where this is going , you &apos;re gonna ask him to New Year &apos;s , aren &apos;t you .
You &apos;re gonna break the pact .
She &apos;s gonna break the pact .
No , no , no , no , no , no .
Yeah , could I just ?
Yeah , &apos; cause I already asked Janice .
What ? !
C &apos;mon , this was a pact !
This was your pact !
I snapped , okay ?
I couldn &apos;t handle the pressure and I snapped .
Yeah , but Janice ?
That-that was like the worst breakup in history !
I &apos;m not saying it was a good idea , I &apos;m saying I snapped !
Hi .
Hi , sorry I &apos;m late .
Too many jokes ... must mock Joey !
Nice shoes , huh ?
Aah , y &apos;killing me !
Ross !
He &apos;s playing with my spatulas again !
Okay , look , he &apos;s not gonna hurt them , right ?
Do you always have to bring him here ?
I didn &apos;t wanna leave him alone .
Alright ?
We- we had our first fight this morning .
I think it has to do with my working late .
I said some things that I didn &apos;t mean , and he- he threw some faeces ... Y &apos;know , if you &apos;re gonna work late , I could look in on him for you .
Oh , that &apos;d be great !
Okay , but if you do , make sure it seems like you &apos;re there to see him , okay , and you &apos;re not like doing it as a favour to me .
Okay , but if he asks , I &apos;m not going to lie .
... But , you can &apos;t actually test this theory , because today &apos;s particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions .
Okay , alright , I have a question , then .
Yuh .
Um , were you planning on kissing me ever ?
Uh , that &apos;s definitely a , uh , valid question .
And , uh , the answer would be yes .
Yes I was .
But , see , I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment , because , well , &apos; cause it &apos;s you .
Sure .
Right .
But , see , the longer I waited , the more phenomenal the kiss had to be , and now we &apos;ve reached a place where it &apos;s just gotta be one of those things where I just like ... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it .
And , uh , I &apos;m not really a , uh , sweeping sorta fella .
Oh , David , I , I think you are a sweeping sorta fella .
I mean , you &apos;re a sweeper !
... trapped inside a physicist &apos;s body .
Rrrreally .
Oh , yeah , oh , I &apos;m sure of it .
You should just do it , just sweep and throw me .
... Now ?
Now ?
Oh yeah , right now .
Okay , okay , okay .
Y &apos;know what , this was just really expensive .
And I &apos;ll take- this was a gift .
Okay , now you &apos;re just kinda tidying .
Okay , what the hell , what the hell .
You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop ?
I can hop .
So tell me something .
What does the phrase &apos; no date pact &apos; mean to you ?
I &apos;m sorry , okay .
It &apos;s just that Chandler has somebody , and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I &apos;d ask Fun Bobby .
Fun Bobby ?
Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby ?
Yeah .
You know more than one Fun Bobby ?
I happen to know a Fun Bob .
Okay , here we go ... Ooh ooh ooh ooh , there &apos;s no room for milk !
There .
Now there is .
Okay , so on our no-date evening , three of you now have dates .
Uh , four .
Four .
Five .
Five .
Sorry .
Paolo &apos;s catching an earlier flight .
Yeah , and I met this really hot single mom at the store .
What &apos;s an elf to do ?
Okay , so I &apos;m gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops ?
Oh , c &apos;mon .
We &apos;ll have , we &apos;ll have a big party , and no-one &apos;ll know who &apos;s with who .
Hey , y &apos;know , this is so not what I needed right now .
What &apos;s the matter ?
Oh , it &apos;s-it &apos;s Marcel .
He keeps shutting me out , y &apos;know ?
He &apos;s walking around all the time dragging his hands ... That &apos;s so weird , I had such a blast with him the other night .
Really .
Yeah , we played , we watched TV .. that juggling thing is amazing .
What , uh ... what juggling thing ?
With the balled-up socks ?
I figured you taught him that .
No .
Y &apos;know , it wasn &apos;t that big a deal .
He just balled up socks ... and a melon ... Phoebe .
Hi .
Oh , hi Max !
Hey , do you know everybody ?
No .
Have you seen David ?
No , no , he hasn &apos;t been around .
Well , if you see him , tell him to pack his bags .
We are going to Minsk .
Minsk ?
Minsk .
It &apos;s in Russia .
I know where Minsk is .
We got the grant .
Three years , all expenses paid .
So when , when do you leave ?
January first .
Hello ?
Hey !
Hi .
Hi !
What-what &apos;re you doing here ?
Um , well , Max told me about Minsk , so congratulations !
This is so exciting !
It &apos;d be even more exciting if we were going .
Oh , you &apos;re not going ?
Oh , why ?
Tell her , David .
&apos;I don &apos;t wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench , on nonononononono .
I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend ! ! &apos;
Thank you , Max .
Thank you .
So-so you &apos;re really not going ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gonna do .
I just- you decide .
Oh don &apos;t do that .
Please .
Oh no no .
No , but I &apos;m asking- Oh , but I can &apos;t do that- No , but I can &apos;t- It &apos;s your thing , and- -make the decision- Okay , um , stay .
Stay .
Stay .
Getting so good at that !
It was Max &apos;s stuff .
I love this artichoke thing !
Oh , don &apos;t tell me what &apos;s in it , the diet starts tomorrow !
You remember Janice .
Vividly .
Hi .
Hi , I &apos;m Sandy .
Sandy !
Hi !
C &apos;mon in !
... You brought your kids .
Yeah .
That &apos;s okay , right ?
Par-tay !
That thing is not coming in here .
&apos;That thing &apos; ?
This is how you greet guests at a party ?
Let me ask you something , if I showed up here with my new girlfriend , she wouldn &apos;t be welcome in your home ?
I &apos;m guessing your new girlfriend wouldn &apos;t urinate on my coffee table .
Okay .
He was more embarrassed about that than anyone .
Okay ?
And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened ... Alright .
Just keep him away from me .
Thank you .
C &apos;mon , Marcel , whaddya say you and I do a little mingling ?
Alright , I &apos;ll , uh ... catch up with you later .
Oh my gosh !
Rachel , honey .. are you okay ?
Where-where &apos;s Paolo ?
Rome .
Jerk missed his flight .
And then ... your face is bloated ?
No .
Okay .
I was at the airport , getting into a cab , when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me .
Something about how it was her cab first .
And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair !
So I &apos;m blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up , and as I &apos;m going to get into a cab she tackles me .
And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle ... oh ... everybody having fun at the party ?
Are people eating my dip ?
Y &apos;know , when I saw you at the store last week , it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf .
Wow , that &apos;s , uh , dirty .
Yeah .
Hey , kids ... Look at him .
I &apos;m not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me , but at least check in .
There you are !
Haaah , you got away from me !
But you found me !
Here , Ross , take our picture .
Smile !
You &apos;re on Janice Camera !
Kill me .
Kill me now .
Hey everybody !
It &apos;s Fun Bobby !
Hey , sorry I &apos;m late .
But my , uh , grandfather , he- died about two hours ago .
But I-I-I couldn &apos;t get a flight out &apos; til tomorrow , so here I am !
Hey Fun Bobby !
Whoah !
Who died ?
It &apos;s gonna be an open casket , y &apos;know , so at least I &apos;ll- I get to see him again .
Oh , I &apos;m gonna blow this one up , and I &apos;m gonna write &apos; Reunited &apos; in glitter .
Alright , Janice , that &apos;s it !
Janice ... Janice ... Hey , Janice , when I invited you to this party I didn &apos;t necessarily think that it meant that we- Oh , no .
Oh , no .
I &apos;m sorry you misunderstood ... Oh my God .
You listen to me , Chandler , you listen to me .
One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me .
Oh , will you give me the thing .
Hi , Max !
Yoko .
I &apos;ve decided to go to Minsk without you .
Wow .
It won &apos;t be the same- but it &apos;ll still be Minsk .
Happy New Year .
Are you alright ?
Yeah , I &apos;m fine , I &apos;m fine .
You &apos;re going to Minsk .
No , I &apos;m ... not going to Minsk .
Oh , you are so going to Minsk .
You belong in Minsk .
You can &apos;t stay here just &apos; cause of me .
Yes I can .
Because if I go it means I have to break up with you , and I can &apos;t break up with you .
Oh yes , yes , yes you can .
Just say , um , &apos; Phoebe , my work is my life and that &apos;s what I have to do right now &apos; .
And I say &apos; your work ? !
Your work ? !
How can you say that ? ! &apos; .
And then you say , um , &apos; it &apos;s tearing me apart , but I have no choice .
Can &apos;t you understand that ? &apos; .
And I say &apos; no !
No !
I can &apos;t understand that ! &apos; .
Uh , ow .
Ooh , sorry .
Um , and , and then you put your arms around me .
And then you put your arms around me .
And , um , and then you tell me that you love me and you &apos;ll never forget me .
I &apos;ll never forget you .
And then you say that it &apos;s almost midnight and you have to go because you don &apos;t wanna start the new year with me if you can &apos;t finish it .
I &apos;m gonna miss you .
You scientist guy .
Hi , this is Dick Clark , live in Times Square .
We &apos;re in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square ...
There y &apos;go , kids .
And then the peacock bit me .
Please kiss me at midnight .
You seen Sandy ?
Ooh .
Uh , I don &apos;t know how to tell you this , but she &apos;s in Monica &apos;s bedroom , getting it on with Max , that scientist geek .
Ooh , look at that , I did know how to tell you .
Vrrbddy , the bll is drrbing .
What ?
The bll is drrbing !
In twenty seconds it &apos;ll be midnight ... And the moment of joy is upon us .
Looks like that no date pact thing worked out .
Everybody looks so happy .
I hate that .
Not everybody &apos;s happy .
Hey Bobby !
Y &apos;know , I uh .. just thought I &apos;d throw this out here .
I &apos;m no math whiz , but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here .
I dunno .
I don &apos;t feel like kissing anyone tonight .
I can &apos;t kiss anyone .
So I &apos;m kissing everyone ?
Nonono , you can &apos;t kiss Ross , that &apos;s your brother .
Perfect .
Perfect .
So now everybody &apos;s getting kissed but me .
Alright , somebody kiss me .
Somebody kiss me , it &apos;s midnight !
Somebody kiss me !
Alrightalrightalright .
There .
I wanted this to work so much .
I mean I &apos;m still in there , changing his diapers , pickin &apos; his fleas ... but he &apos;s just phoning it in .
Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn &apos;t love you back .
... I think that bitch cracked my tooth .
Do you think they have yesterday &apos;s daily news ?
Why ?
Just wanna check my horoscope , see if it was right .
Oh my God .
Phoebe .
Don &apos;t look now , but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression .
Where ?
Ooh , come to Momma .
He &apos;s coming .
Be cool , be cool , be cool .
Nice hat .
Thanks .
We should do something .
Whistle .
We are not going to whistle .
Come on , do it .
No !
Do it !
No !
Do it do it do it !
Woo-woo !
I can &apos;t believe you did that !
Why did I &apos; woo-hoo &apos; ?
I mean , what was I hoping would happen ?
That-that he &apos;d turn round and say &apos; I love that sound , I must have you now &apos; ?
I just wish there was something we could do .
Hello .
Hello , Coma Guy .
GET UP , YOU GIRL SCOUT !
UP !
UP !
UP !
Phoebe , what are you doing ?
Maybe nobody &apos;s tried this .
I wish we at least knew his name ... Look at that face .
I mean , even sleeping , he looks smart .
I bet he &apos;s a lawyer .
Yeah , but did you see the dents in his knuckles ?
That means he &apos;s artistic .
Okay , he &apos;s a lawyer , who teaches sculpting on the side .
And- he can dance !
Oh !
And , he &apos;s the kinda guy who , when you &apos;re talking , he &apos;s listening , y &apos;know , and not saying &apos; Yeah , I understand &apos; but really wondering what you look like naked .
I wish all guys could be like him .
I know .
Are there no conscious men in the city for you two ?
He doesn &apos;t have anyone .
Yeah , we-we feel kinda responsible .
I can &apos;t believe you said woowoo .
I don &apos;t even say woowoo .
Oh , she &apos;s coming up !
She &apos;s coming up !
Folks , when we come back we &apos;ll be talking about her new book , &apos; Euphoria Unbound &apos; : the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing .
You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one .
Y &apos;know , we don &apos;t have to watch this .
Weekend At Bernie &apos;s is on Showtime , HBO , and Cinemax .
No way , forget it .
C &apos;mon , she &apos;s your mom !
Exactly .
Weekend At Bernie &apos;s !
Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty , thirty times !
No ?
Chandler , I gotta tell you , I love your mom &apos;s books !
I love her books !
I cannot get on a plane without one !
I mean , this is so cool !
Yeah , well , you wouldn &apos;t think it was cool if you &apos;re eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of &apos; Mistress Bitch . &apos;
C &apos;mon , Chandler , I love your mom .
I think she &apos;s a blast .
You can say that because she &apos;s not your mom .
Oh , please ...
Bona sera .
Oh , hi sweetie .
When did Rigatoni get back from Rome ?
Last night .
Ah , so then his plane didn &apos;t explode in a big ball of fire ? ...
Just a dream I had- but , phew .
Hey hey hey !
She &apos;s on !
Ah !
Nora Bing !
... Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London ?
What is that all about ?
Your mom was arrested ?
Shhh , busy beaming with pride .
... This is kind of embarrassing , but occasionally after I &apos;ve been intimate with a man ... Now why would she say that &apos;s embarrassing ?
Shhh .
... I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken .
THAT &apos;S TOO MUCH INFORMATION ! !
Alright , so now you &apos;re doing this whole book tour thing , how is that going ?
Oh , fine .
I &apos;m leaving for New York tomorrow , which I hate- but I get to see my son , who I love ... Awww !
This is the way that I find out .
Most moms use the phone .
Y &apos;know , don &apos;t take this wrong , I-I just don &apos;t see you a-as a mom , somehow ..
I don &apos;t mean that , I don &apos;t mean that bad ... Oh no , I am a fabulous mom !
I bought my son his first condoms .
... And then he burst into flames .
Let &apos;s see .
Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill ... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again ... the high today was forty-five ... and- oh , teams played sports .
What about Glen ?
He could be a Glen .
Nah ... not-not special enough .
Ooh !
How about Agamemnon ?
Waaay too special .
I am famished .
What do I want ...
Please God don &apos;t let it be Kung Pow Chicken .
Oh , you watched the show !
What &apos;d you think ?
Well , I think you need to come out of your shell just a little .
What is this dive ?
Only you could &apos;ve picked this place .
Oooh , c &apos;mon , shut up , it &apos;s fun .
Gimme a hug .
Well , I think we &apos;re ready for some tequila .
I know I am .
Who &apos;s doing shots ?
Yeah .
I &apos;m in .
There y &apos;go .
Ross ?
Uh , I &apos;m not really a shot drinking kinda guy .
Hi !
Sorry- sorry we &apos;re late , we , uh , kinda just , y &apos;know , lost track of time .
... But a man can change .
Anyone want me to appraise anything ?
Mrs. Bing , I have to tell you , I &apos;ve read everything you &apos;ve ever written .
No , I mean it !
I mean , when I read Euphoria at Midnight , all I wanted to do was become a writer .
Oh , please , honey , listen , if I can do it , anybody can .
You just start with half a dozen European cities , throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia , and bam !
You have got yourself a book .
Myyy mother , ladies and gentlemen .
Yeah , any messages for room 226 ?
You okay there , slugger ?
Yeah , I &apos;m fine , I &apos;m fine .
What is with you tonight ?
Nothing .
Nothing nothing nothing .
Okay , thank you .
It &apos;s the Italian Hand-Licker , isn &apos;t it .
No .
It &apos;s the one he &apos;s licking .
She &apos;s supposed to be with you .
You &apos;re good .
Oh , Ross , listen to me .
I have sold a hundred million copies of my books , and y &apos;know why ?
The girl on the cover with her nipples showing ?
No .
Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with .
Believe me , I cannot sell a Paolo .
People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo .
C &apos;mon , the guy &apos;s a secondary character , a , y &apos;know , complication you eventually kill off .
When ?
He &apos;s not a hero .
... You know who our hero is .
The guy on the cover with his nipples showing ?
No , it &apos;s you !
Please .
No , really , c &apos;mon .
You &apos;re smart , you &apos;re sexy ...
Right .
You are gonna be fine , believe me .
Uh-oh ... Uhhhh ....
I &apos;ll just pee in the street .
Hey , is Chandler here ?
Yeah .
Okay , uh , about last night , um , Chandler .. you didn &apos;t tell ...
Okay , &apos; cause I &apos;m thinking- we don &apos;t need to tell Chandler , I mean , it was just a kiss , right ?
One kiss ?
No big deal ?
Right ?
Right .
No big deal .
Okay .
In Bizarro World ! !
You broke the code !
What code ?
You don &apos;t kiss your friend &apos;s mom !
Sisters are okay , maybe a hot-lookin &apos; aunt ... but not a mom , never a mom !
What are you guys doing out here ?
Uh .. uh .. Well , Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game .
But , um , apparently , somebody overslept .
Yeah , well , you don &apos;t have your racket .
No , no I don &apos;t , because it &apos;s being restrung , somebody was supposed to bring me one .
Yeah , well you didn &apos;t call and leave your grip size .
Okay , you guys spend waaaay too much time together .
Okay , I &apos;m scum , I &apos;m scum .
Ross , how could you let this happen ?
I don &apos;t know , God , I ... well , it &apos;s not like she &apos;s a regular mom , y &apos;know ?
She &apos;s , she &apos;s sexy , she &apos;s ... You don &apos;t think my mom &apos;s sexy ?
Well ... not in the same way ...
I &apos;ll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day , alright ?
You think it &apos;s easy giving birth to seven children ?
Okay , I think we &apos;re getting into a weird area here ... Hey .
Hey .
What &apos;re you guys doing out here ?
Well , not playing raquetball !
He forgot to leave his grip size !
He didn &apos;t get the goggles !
Well , sounds like you two have issues .
Goodbye , baby .
Ciao , bela .
Do they wait for me to do this ?
So are you gonna tell him ?
Why would I tell him ?
How about &apos; cause if you don &apos;t , his mother might .
Oh ... What are you guys doing here ?
Uhhhh .... he &apos;s not even wearing a jockstrap !
... What did I ask ?
Hi .
Hi .
What are you doing here ?
Nothing , I just thought I &apos;d stop by .. y &apos;know , after the uh ... that I .. y &apos;know , so what are you doing here ?
I &apos;m not really here .
Just thought I &apos;d drop these off ... on the way .. my way ... Do you come here a lot ?
Without me ?
No .
No !
No !
... So , um , do you think he &apos;s doing any better than he was this morning ?
How would I know ?
I-I wasn &apos;t here .
Really ?
Not even to , um , change his PAJAMAS ? !
Oh my God .
You &apos;re my friend .
I-I had to tell you .
I can &apos;t believe it .
Paolo kissed my mom ?
Yeah , um , I don &apos;t know if you noticed , but he had a lot to drink , and you know how he gets when he &apos;s drun .. uh ...
I can &apos;t do this , I did it , it was me , I &apos;m sorry , I kissed your mom .
What ?
I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo , and I think I had too much tequila , and Nora- um , Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice , y &apos;know , and- But nothing happened , nothing- Ask Joey , Joey , uh , came in- You knew about this ?
Uh ... y &apos;know , knowledge is a tricky thing .
I spent the entire day with you , why didn &apos;t you tell me ? !
Hey , hey , hey , you &apos;re lucky I caught them when I did , or else who knows what woulda happened .
Thanks , man , big help .
I can &apos;t believe this !
What the hell were you thinking ?
I wasn &apos;t- I mean , I- Y &apos;know , of all my friends , no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you .
I know- I can &apos;t believe you did this .
Chandler- Me neither , y &apos;know what- I &apos;m still mad at you for not telling me .
What are you mad at me for ? !
Chandler- You gotta let me slam the door !
Chandler , I didn &apos;t kiss her , he did !
See what happens when you break the code ?
Joey- Ah !
Huh ?
Hey .
Hey .
&apos;A Woman Undone , by Rachel Karen Green &apos; .
Yeah .
Thought I &apos;d give it a shot .
I &apos;m still on the first chapter .
Now , do you think his &apos; love stick can be liberated from its denim prison &apos; ?
Yeah , I &apos;d say so .
And there &apos;s no &apos; j &apos; in &apos; engorged &apos; .
Hey Rach .
Hey .
Hello .

Um , Rachel can we do this now ?
Okay .

Chandler , can I just say something ?
I-I know you &apos;re still mad at me , I just wanna say that there were two people there that night .
Okay ?
Two sets of lips .
Yes , well , I expect this from her .
Okay ?
She &apos;s always been a Freudian nightmare .
Okay , well , if she always behaves like this , why don &apos;t you say something ?
Because it &apos;s complicated , it &apos;s complex- Hey , you kissed my mom !
We &apos;re rehearsing a Greek play .
That &apos;s very funny .
We done now ?
No !
Okay , you mean , you &apos;re not gonna talk to her , you &apos;re not gonna tell her how you feel ?
That would be no .
Look , just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn &apos;t mean you know her .
Alright ?
Trust me , you can &apos;t talk to her .
Okay , &apos; you &apos; can &apos;t , or you can &apos;t ?
Okay , that &apos;s my finger .
That &apos;s , that &apos;s my knee .
Still doing the play .
Aaah !

You look good !
I feel good !

Oh , sorry .
I &apos;m Phoebe Buffay .
I &apos;m Monica Geller .
I &apos;ve been taking care of you .
Well , we both have .
So , the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys ?
Well , actually it &apos;s just from me .
I got you the foot massager .
You know who shaved you ?
That was me .
I read to you .
I sang .
Hah !
Well , ... thanks .
Oh , my pleasure .
You &apos;re welcome .
So .
I guess I &apos;ll see you around .
What , that &apos;s it ?
&quot; See you around ? &quot;
Well , what do you want me to say ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe , um , &quot; That was nice ? &quot;
Admit something to me ?
&quot; I &apos;ll call you ? &quot;
Alright , I &apos;ll call you .
I don &apos;t think you mean that .
This is so typical .
Y &apos;know , we give , and we give , and we give .
And then- we just get nothing back !
And then one day , y &apos;know , it &apos;s just , you wake up , and &quot; See you around ! &quot;
Let &apos;s go , Phoebe .
Y &apos;know what ?
We thought you were different .
But I guess it was just the coma .
Car &apos;s waiting downstairs , I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends .
Anything you want from Lisbon ?
No , just knowing you &apos;re gonna be there is enough .
Alright , well , be good , I love you .
You kissed my best Ross !
... Or something to that effect .
O-kay .
Look , it , it was stupid .
Really stupid .
Really stupid .
And I don &apos;t even know how it happened .
I &apos;m sorry , honey , I promise it will never happen again .
Are we okay now ?
Yeah .
No .
No ... Ah , the forbidden love of a man and his door .
Shh .
He did it .
He told her off , and not just about the kiss , about everything .
You &apos;re kidding .
No , no .
He said &quot; When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom ? &quot;
Wow !
Then she came back with &quot; The question is , when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a bomb ? &quot;
&apos;Kay , wait a minute , are you sure she didn &apos;t say &quot; When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom ? &quot;
That makes more sense .
So , what &apos;s going on now ?
I dunno , I &apos;ve been standing here spelling it out for you !
I don &apos;t hear anything .
Oh , wait , wait , wait .
Whaddya see ?
Hard to tell , they &apos;re so tiny and upside-down .
Wait , wait .
They &apos;re walking away ... they &apos;re walking away ... No , no they &apos;re not , they &apos;re coming right at us !
Run !
Run !
You okay , kiddo ?
Yeah , okay .
Alright .
Nice save .
Mrs. Bing .
Mr. Geller .
Hey .
You mean that ?
Yeah , why not .
So I told her .
Yeah ?
How &apos;d it go ?
Awful .
Awful .
Couldn &apos;ta gone worse .
Well , howdya feel ?
Pretty good !
I told her .
Well , see ?
So , maybe it wasn &apos;t such a bad idea , y &apos;know , me kissing your mom , uh ?
Huh ?
But .. we don &apos;t have to go down that road .
Okay .
Now this is just the first chapter , and I want your absolute honest opinion .
Oh , oh , and on page two , he &apos;s not &apos; reaching for her heaving beasts &apos; .
What &apos;s a &apos; niffle &apos; ?
You usually find them on the &apos; heaving beasts &apos; .
Alright , alright , so I &apos;m not a great typist ...
Wait , did you get to the part about his &apos; huge throbbing pens &apos; ?
Tell ya , you don &apos;t wanna be around when he starts writing with those !
Alright , that &apos;s it !
Give it back !
That &apos;s it !
Nooo !
No-no-no-no , we &apos;re done .
Aunt Syl , stop yelling !
All I &apos;m saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna , I would have made vegetarian lasagna .
Well , the meat &apos;s only every third layer , maybe you could scrape .
Ross , did you really read all these baby books ?
Yup !
You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman &apos;s uterus , no compass , and I can find my way out of there like that !
Ooh , this is cool ... it says in some parts of the world , people actually eat the placenta .
And , we &apos;re done with the yogurt .
Sorry .
Aunt Syl , I did this as a favor , I am not a caterer .
What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas ?
Nice talk , Aunt Syl .
You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth ?
Hey Ross , listen , you know that right now , your baby &apos;s only this big ?
This is your baby .
Hi Daddy !
Hello !
How come you don &apos;t live with Mommy ?
How come Mommy lives with that other lady ?
What &apos;s a lesbian ?
Honey , you can say it , Poconos , Poconos , it &apos;s like Poc-o-nos Ah , poke a nose , mmm Mma , Mma , Mmaah So , did I hear Poconos ?
Yes , my sister &apos;s giving us her place for the weekend .
Woo-hoo , first weekend away together !
Yeah , that &apos;s a big step .
I know ... Ah , it &apos;s just a weekend , big deal !
Wasn &apos;t this supposed to be just a fling , huh ?
Shouldn &apos;t it be ... flung by now ?
I mean , we are way past the fling thing , I mean , I am feeling things that I &apos;ve only read about in Danielle Steele books , you know ?
I mean , when I &apos;m with him , I &apos;m totally , totally ... ... nauseous , I &apos;m physically nauseous .
What am I supposed to do , huh ?
Call immigration ?
I could call immigration !
I love babies , with their little baby shoes , and their little baby toes , and their little baby hands ... Ok , you &apos;re going to have to stop that , forever !
Need a new table .
You think ?
Hey hey , come on in !
Hey , hello !
mmwa !
I brought all the books , and Monica sends her love , along with this lasagna .
Oh great !
Is it vegetarian , &apos; cause Susan doesn &apos;t eat meat .
I &apos;m pretty sure that it is ...
So , I got the results of the amnio today .
Oh , tell me , tell me , is everything , uhh .... ?
Totally and completely healthy !
Oh , that &apos;s great , that is great !
Hey , when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis ?
Uh , that &apos;s our friend Tanya .
Of course it &apos;s your friend Tanya .
Don &apos;t you want to know about the sex ?
The sex ?
Um , I &apos;m having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together , when you throw in Tanya , yaw ...
The sex of the baby , Ross .
Oh , you know the sex of the baby ?
Oh , oh-oh-oh !
Do you want to know ?
No , no , no , no , no , I don &apos;t want to know , absolutely not .
I think , you know , I think you should know until you look down there , and say , oop , there it is !
Or isn &apos;t ... Oh , hello Ross !
Susan ...
So , so , did you hear ?
Yes , we did , everything &apos;s A-OK !
Oh , that &apos;s so ...
It really is ... do we know ... ?
Yes , we certainly do , it &apos;s going to be ... Oh , hey hey hey , ho ho ho , hello , guy who doesn &apos;t want to know , standing right here !
Oh , well , is it what we thought it would be ?
Mm-hmmm Ok , what , what ... ok , what did we think it was going to be ?
It &apos;s a ... No , no , no I don &apos;t want to know , don &apos;t want to know .
Ok , you know , I should probably , I should probably just go .
Well , thanks for the books .
No problem , ok , mmmwa oh , mmmwa Susan ... All right , who should we call first , your folks , or Deb and Rona ?
Hello ?
Uh , never mind , I don &apos;t want to know .
Ok , so it &apos;s just because it was my table , I have to buy a new one ?
That &apos;s the rule .
What rule ?
There &apos;s no rule , if anything , you owe me a table !
How &apos;d you get to that ?
Well , I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio You knew about that ?
Well , let &apos;s just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination .
Ok , ok , How about if we split it ?
What do you mean , like , buy it together ?
Yeah You think we &apos;re ready for something like that ?
Why not ?
Well , it &apos;s a pretty big commitment , I mean , what if one of us wants to move out ?
Why , are you moving out ?
I &apos;m not moving out .
You &apos;d tell me if you were moving out right Yeah , yeah , it &apos;s just that with my last roommate Kip ... Aw , I know all about Kip !
It &apos;s just that we bought a hibachi together , and then he ran off and got married , and things got pretty ugly .
Well , let me ask you something , was Kip a better roommate than me ?
Aw , don &apos;t do that We &apos;ve got a couple changes in your schedule .
Your 4 : 00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4 : 30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5 : 30 shiatsu .

I mean , I couldn &apos;t not know , I mean , if , if the doctor knows , and Carol knows , and Susan knows .... And Monica knows ... Wha , heh , how could you know , I don &apos;t even know !

Uma Thurman .

The actress !

Feminist issue .
That &apos;s where I went !
She is gonna hate me .
Yeah , well ... Will you pick one , just pick one !
Here , how about that one ?
That &apos;s patio furniture !
So what , like people are gonna come in and think , &quot; Uh-oh , I &apos;m outside again ? &quot;
Of course !
What about the birds ?
I don &apos;t know , birds just don &apos;t say , &quot; Hello , sit here , eat something . &quot;
You pick one .
All right , how about the ladybugs ?
Oh , so , forget about the birds , but big red insects suggest fine dining !

Kip would have liked the birds !
Hey !
Hi Pheebs !
Are you moving out ?
No , these aren &apos;t all my suitcases .
This one &apos;s Paolo &apos;s .
Um , um , Rachel can we talk for a sec ?
Well , sure ... just a sec , though , &apos; cause Paolo &apos;s on his way over .
Oh !
Ok , um , ok , um , Oh , Pheebs , Pheebs ... Ok , um , we haven &apos;t known each other for that long a time , and , um , there are three things that you should know about me .
One , my friends are the most important thing in my life , two , I never lie , and three , I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world .
Ok , thanks Pheebs Oh my God , why have I never tasted these before ? !
Oh , I don &apos;t make them a lot because I don &apos;t think it &apos;s fair to the other cookies All right , well , you &apos;re right , these are the best oatmeal cookies I &apos;ve ever had .
Which proves that I never lie .
I guess you don &apos;t .
Paolo made a pass at me .
So , what do you think ?
I think It &apos;s the most beautiful table I &apos;ve ever seen .
I know !
So how does this work , you going to balance the plates on these little guys &apos; heads ?
Who cares , we &apos;ll eat at the sink !
Come on , let &apos;s play !
Heads up Ross !
Score !
You suck !
Are you okay ?
I need some milk .
Ok , I &apos;ve got milk Here you go ... Oh !
Better ?
No ... oh , I feel so stupid !
Oh , I think about the other day with you guys and I was all &quot; Oh , Paolo , he &apos;s so great , he makes me feel so ... &quot; Oh , God , I &apos;m so embarrassed !
I &apos;m so embarrassed , I &apos;m the one he hit on !
Pheebs , if I had never met him this never would have happened !
I &apos;m so sorry !
No I &apos;m sorry !
No I &apos;m sorry !
No I &apos;m sorry !
No , wait , oh , what are we sorry about ?
I don &apos;t know ... right , he &apos;s the pig !
Such a pig !
Oh , God , he &apos;s such a pig , Oh he &apos;s like a ...
He &apos;s like a big disgusting ... ... like a ... ... pig ... pig man !
Yes , good !
Ok ... Oh , but he was my pig man ... how did I not see this ?
Oh !
I know !
It &apos;s because ... he &apos;s gorgeous , and he &apos;s charming , and when he looks at you ... Ok , Ok , Pheebs ...
The end .
Oh , God ... Should I not have told you ?
No , no , trust , me , it &apos;s , it &apos;s , it &apos;s much better that I know .
Uh , I just liked it better before it was better ...
I think she took it pretty well .
You know Paolo &apos;s over there right now , so ... We should get over there and see if she &apos;s okay .
Just one ... second !
Score !
Game !
Come on .
Ah ... ooh !
Well , looks like , uh , we kicked your butts .
No-no , she kicked our butts .
You could be on the Olympic standing-there team .
Come on , two on one .
What are you still doing here ?
She just broke up with the guy , it &apos;s time for you to swoop in !
What , now ?
Yes , now is when you swoop !
You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there , the first guy Rachel sees is you , She &apos;s gotta know that you &apos;re everything he &apos;s not !
You &apos;re like , like the anti-Paolo !
My Catholic friend is right .
She &apos;s distraught .
You &apos;re there for her .
You pick up the pieces , and then you usher in the age of Ross !
No , that &apos;s cold , that &apos;s cold , that &apos;s ... How &apos;s it going ?
Don &apos;t stare .
Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony , now there &apos;s just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving , , Ok , that is either , &quot; How could you ? &quot;
or , &quot; Enormous breasts ! &quot;
Here he comes !
Ooh !
Uh , I am , uh , to say good-bye .
Oh , ok bye-bye .
Paolo , I really hate you for what you did to Rachel , but I still have five of these , so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles .
Grazie .
Paolo , I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say ... Oh , just look at her ... Oh you guys , I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she &apos;s not overwhelmed ... Oh , you &apos;re right .
... and I really think it should be me .
Hey .
Hey .
You all right ?
Ooh , I &apos;ve been better ... Come here .
Listen , you deserve so much better than him ... you know , I mean , you , you , you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you .
Oh , Ross ... What ?
I am so sick of guys .
I don &apos;t want to look at another guy , I don &apos;t want to think about another guy , I don &apos;t even want to be near another guy .
Huh .
Oh Ross , you &apos;re so great !
Ohhhh Ooh ... hey honey , are you all right ?
Oh ... You ok ?
... medium ... hmm ... any cookies left ?
Yep !
See , Rach , uh , see , I don &apos;t think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer .
I really don &apos;t .
I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process .
No .
I just need to be by myself for a while , you know ?
I just got to figure out what I want Uh , no , no , see , because not ... not all guys are going to be a Paolo .
No , I know , I know , and I &apos;m sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one .
What ?
What ?
I-I &apos;m , I &apos;m having a boy ?
Uh ... no .
No , no , in fact , you &apos;re not having a boy .
Wha-I &apos;m having , I &apos;m having a boy !
Huh , am I having a boy ?
Yes , you &apos;re having a boy !
I &apos;m having a boy !
Oh , I &apos;m having a boy !
Wha- Wha- What is it ?
I &apos;m having a boy !
I-I &apos;m having a boy !
Hey !
Hey !
We already knew that !
I &apos;m having a son .
Um ...
Yes !
And that would be a shut-down !
Shut-out ! !
Where are you guys going ?
Come on , one more game !
Uh , it &apos;s 2 : 30 in the morning !
Yeah , get out !
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment !
Come on , I &apos;ll only use my left hand , huh ?
Come on , wussies !
All right , ok , I gotta go .
I &apos;m going , and I &apos;m gone .
One more game ?
Oh yeah !
That is it !
You just barge in here , you don &apos;t knock I &apos;m sorry !
You have no respect for anybody &apos;s privacy !
Rachel , wait , wait .
No , you wait !
This is ridiculous !
Can I just say one thing ?
What ?
What ? !
That &apos;s a relatively open weave and I can still see your ... nipular areas .
Oh ! !
Oh , honey , honey , tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are , like , other things .
Y &apos;know ?
Like , the phone rings and she takes a shower .
That &apos;s pretty much it .
Oops !
But you tell it really well , sweetie .
Thanks .
Okay , now go away so we can talk about you .
Okay .
I &apos;ll miss you .
Isn &apos;t he great ?
He &apos;s so cute !
And he seems to like you so much .
I know , I know .
So sweet ... and so complicated .
And for a shrink , he &apos;s not too shrinky , y &apos;know ?
So , you think you &apos;ll do it on his couch ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
I think that &apos;s a little weird , y &apos;know ?
Vinyl .
Okaaay .
Any of you guys want anything else ?
Oh , yes , could I have one of those .
No , I &apos;m sorry , we &apos;re all out of those .
Anybody else ?
Okay .
Did I , uh , did I miss something ?
No , she &apos;s still upset because I saw her boobies .
You what ?
Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies ?
It was an accident .
Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts .
Okay , okay , could we change the subject , please ?
Yeah , &apos; cause hello , these are not her boobies , these are her breasts .
Okay , Pheebs , I was hoping for more of a change .
Y &apos;know , I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re so embarrassed , they were very nice boobies .
Nice ?
They were nice .
I mean , that &apos;s it ?
I mean , mittens are nice .
Okaaay , rock , hard place , me .
You &apos;re so funny !
He &apos;s really funny !
I wouldn &apos;t wanna be there when when the laughter stops .
Whoah whoah , back up there , Sparky .
What &apos;d you mean by that ?
Oh , just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues .
Y &apos;know , that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance .
Huh .
I mean hey !
I just met you , I don &apos;t know you from Adam .
... Only child , right ?
Parents divorced before you hit puberty .
Uhhuh , how did you know that ?
It &apos;s textbook .
Hey you guys .
Hey , you all know my dad , right ?
Hey !
Hey , Mr. Trib !
Hey , how long are you in the city ?
Just for a coupla days .
I got a job midtown .
I figure I &apos;m better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry .
I don &apos;t know this one .
Oh , this is my friend Roger .
Hi .
Hey , hey .
Good to meet you , Roger .
You too , sir .
What happened to the , uh , puppet guy ?
Dad , dad .
Oh , &apos; scuse me .
So Ross , uh , how &apos;s the wife ?
Off there too , uh ?
Uh , Chandler , quick , say something funny !
Gotta go .
I miss you too , I love you , but it &apos;s getting real late now Hey Ma .
Listen , I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida , and ...
Excuse me ?
Did you know this isn &apos;t Ma ?
Her name &apos;s Ronni .
She &apos;s a pet mortician .
Sure .
So how long you been ...
Remember when you were a little kid , I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships ?
Since then ? !
No , it &apos;s only been six years .
I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you &apos;d know that I wasn &apos;t always such a terrible guy .
... Joe .
Y &apos;ever been in love ?
... I d &apos;know .
Then y &apos;haven &apos;t .
You &apos;re burning your tomatoes .
You &apos;re one to talk .
Joe , your dad &apos;s in love big time .
And the worst part of it is , it &apos;s with two different women .
Oh man .
Please tell me one of &apos; em is Ma .
Of course , course one of &apos; em &apos;s Ma .
What &apos;s the matter with you .
It &apos;s like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life .
He &apos;s like actually some spy , working for the C.I.A.
That &apos;d be cool ....
This blows !
I know , I mean , why can &apos;t parents just stay parents ?
Why do they have to become people ?
Why do they have ... Why can &apos;t you stop staring at my breasts ?
What ?
What ?
Did you not get a good enough look the other day ?
Alright , alright .
We &apos;re all adults here , there &apos;s only one way to resolve this .
Since you saw her boobies , I think , uh , you &apos;re gonna have to show her your peepee .
Y &apos;know , I don &apos;t see that happening ?
C &apos;mon , he &apos;s right .
Tit for tat .
Well I &apos;m not showing you my &apos; tat . &apos;
Hello ?
It &apos;s Phoebe .
And Rog .
C &apos;mon up .
Oh , good .
Rog is here .
What &apos;s the matter with Rog ?
Yeah .
Oh , it &apos;s nothing , it &apos;s a little thing ...
I hate that guy .
What , so he was a little analytical .
That &apos;s what he does , y &apos;know ?
C &apos;mon , he &apos;s not that bad .
Y &apos;see , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong .
Why would I marry her if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian ?
I dunno .
Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail .
Why ?
Why would I why ?
Why ?
Why ?
Why ?
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe maybe low self-esteem , maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling , maybe you ... Wait-wait , go back to that sibling thing .
Well , I don &apos;t know .
I mean , it &apos;s conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents .
That that &apos;s ridiculous !
I don &apos;t feel guilty for her failures !
Oh !
So you think I &apos;m a failure !
Isn &apos;t he good ?
Nonono , thatthat &apos;s not what I was saying ... Y &apos;know , all these years , I thought you were on my side .
But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they &apos;d keep liking you better !
Hey , I married a lesbian to make you look good !
You &apos;re right !
I mean you &apos;re right !
It wasn &apos;t just the Weebles , but it was the Weeble Play Palace , and and the Weebles &apos; Cruise Ship .
Oh , which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in .
That &apos;s tough .
Tough stuff .
C &apos;mon , Pheebs , we &apos;re gonna catch that movie , we gotta get going .
Oh , okay .
Feel better , Rachel , &apos; kay ?
Geez , we &apos;re gonna be late , sweetie ... Oh , okay .
Listen , thanks for everything , Mon .
You &apos;re welcome .
Listen guys , it was great seeing you again .
Mon , um , easy on those cookies , okay ?
Remember , they &apos;re just food , they &apos;re not love .
Hate that guy !
Night , you guys .
Oh look , it &apos;s the woman we ordered .
Hey .
Can , uh , can we help you ?
Oh , no thanks , I &apos;m just waiting for , uh , Joey Tribbiani .
I &apos;m Joey Tribbiani .
Oh no , not you , big Joey .
Oh my God , you &apos;re so much cuter than your pictures !
I-I &apos;m , I &apos;m Ronni .... Cheese Nip ?
Uh , Joey &apos;s having an embolism , but I &apos;d go for a Nip , y &apos;know ?
Now , y &apos;see , most people , when their pets pass on , they want &apos; em sorta laid out like they &apos;re sleeping .
But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose .
Like , chasing their tail , or , uh , jumping to catch a frisbee .
Joey , if I go first , I wanna be looking for my keys .
That &apos;s a good one !
Hey , Joe .
Dad , Ronni &apos;s here .
Huh ?
Hi .
Hey !
Hello , babe !
Wh what &apos;re what &apos;re you doing here ?
Oh , uh , well , you left your good hair at my apartment , I figured you &apos;d need it tomorrow for your meeting .
Thank you .
Uh ...
So , who &apos;s up for a big game of Kerplunk ?
Look , I uh , I shouldn &apos;ta come .
I-I &apos;d better get going , I don &apos;t wanna miss the last train .
I don &apos;t want you taking that thing .
Oh , where &apos;m I gonna stay , here ?
Who-ah-ho .
We &apos;ll go to a hotel .
We &apos;ll go to a hotel .
No you won &apos;t .
No we won &apos;t .
If you go to a hotel you &apos;ll be ... doing stuff .
I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you .
You &apos;re gonna keep an eye on us ?
That &apos;s right , mister , and I don &apos;t care how old you are , as long as you &apos;re under my roof you &apos;re gonna live by my rules .
And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend .
Wow .
He &apos;s strict .
Now dad , you &apos;ll be in my room , Ronni uh , you can stay in Chandler &apos;s room .
Thanks .
You &apos;re , uh , you &apos;re a good kid .
C &apos;mon , I &apos;ll show you to my room .
... That sounds so weird when it &apos;s not followed by &quot; No thanks , it &apos;s late . &quot;
Okay .
Now this is just for tonight .
Starting tomorrow , you gotta make a change .
This has gone on long enough .
What kinda change ?
Well , either you break it off with Ronni I can &apos;t do that !
Then you gotta come clean with Ma !
This is not right !
Yeah , but this is I don &apos;t wanna hear it !
Now go to my room !
Hey , Kicky .
What &apos;re you doing ?
Just trying to get comfortable .
I can &apos;t sleep in my underwear .
Well , you &apos;re gonna .
I &apos;ve been thinking .
Y &apos;know , about how I &apos;m always seeing girls on top of girls ... Are they end to end , or tall like pancakes ?
Y &apos;know what I mean , about how I &apos;m always going out with all these women .
And I always figured , when the right one comes along , I &apos;d be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance , y &apos;know ?
Now I &apos;m looking at my dad , thinking ... Hey , you &apos;re not him .
You &apos;re you .
When they were all over you to go into your father &apos;s pipe-fitting business , did you cave ?
No .
No .
You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business .
Now that wasn &apos;t easy , but you did it !
And I &apos;d like to believe that when the right woman comes along , you will have the courage and the guts to say &quot; No thanks , I &apos;m married . &quot;
You really think so ?
Yeah .
I really do .
Thanks , Chandler .
Get off !
Hi .
Hi ... May I help you ?
Yeah , uh , Joey said I could use your shower , since , uh , Chandler &apos;s in ours ?
Okay ... who are you ?
Oh , I &apos;m Ronni .
Ronni Rappelano ?
The mistress ?
Oh , c &apos;mon in .
Thanks .
Hi , I &apos;m Rachel .
Hi .
Bathroom &apos;s up there .
Great .
Hey , listen , Ronni , how long would you say Chandler &apos;s been in the shower ?
Oh , like , uh , five minutes ?
Perfect .
Fasten your seatbelts , it &apos;s peepee time .
Hey , Mr. Trib .
Hey .
Morning , dear .
Chandler Bing ?
It &apos;s time to see your thing .
What &apos;s the matter with you ? !
I thought it was Chandler !
What ?
What ?
You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing !
Sorry , my my thing was in there with me .
Hey , Pheebs .
Hey .
How &apos;s it going ?
Good .
Oh oh !
Roger &apos;s having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys .
So what &apos;s going on ?
Nothing , um , it &apos;s just , um ...
It &apos;s Roger .
I dunno , there &apos;s just something about ... Basically we just feel that he &apos;s ... We hate that guy .
Yeah .
Hate him .
We &apos;re sorry , Pheebs , we &apos;re sorry .
Uh-huh .
Okay .
Okay , don &apos;t you think , maybe , though , it &apos;s just that he &apos;s so perceptive that it freaks you out ?
... No , we hate him .
We &apos;re sorry .
Ma !
What &apos;re you doing here ?
I came to give you this and this .
Oww !
Big ring !
Why did you have to fill your father &apos;s head with all that garbage about making things right ?
Things were fine the way they were !
There &apos;s chicken in there , put it away .
For God &apos;s sake , Joey , really .
Hold on , you-you knew ?
Of course I knew !
What did you think ?
Your father is no James Bond .
You should &apos;ve heard some of his cover stories .
&quot; I &apos;m sleeping over at my accountant &apos;s , &quot; I mean , what is that ?
Please !
So then how could you I mean , how could you ? !
Do you remember how your father used to be ?
Always yelling , always yelling nothing made him happy , nothing made him happy , not that wood shop , not those stupid little ships in the bottle , nothing .
Now he &apos;s happy !
I mean , it &apos;s nice , he has a hobby .
Ma , I don &apos;t mean to be disrespectful , but ... what the hell are you talking about ? !
I mean , what about you ?
Me ?
I &apos;m fine .
Look , honey , in an ideal world , there &apos;d be no her , and your father would look like Sting .
And I &apos;ll tell you something else .
Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along , he &apos;s been so ashamed of himself that he &apos;s been more attentive , he &apos;s been more loving ...
I mean , it &apos;s like every day &apos;s our anniversary .
I &apos;m ... happy ... for you ?
Well don &apos;t be , because now everything &apos;s screwed up .
I just want it the way it was .
Ma , I &apos;m sorry .
I just did what I thought you &apos;d want .
I know you did , cookie .
Oh , I know you did .
So tell me .
Did you see her ?
Yeah .
You &apos;re ten times prettier than she is .
That &apos;s sweet .
Could I take her ?
With this ring ?
No contest .
What &apos;s wrong , sweetie ?
Nothing , nothing .
Aaaah , what &apos;s wrong , c &apos;mon .
It &apos;s , I mean , it &apos;s nothing , I &apos;m fine .
It &apos;s my friends .
They-they have a liking problem with you .
In that , um , they don &apos;t .
Oh .
They don &apos;t .
But they don &apos;t see all the wonderfulness that I see .
They don &apos;t see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff .
They just think you &apos;re a little ... What ?
Intense and creepy .
Oh .
But I don &apos;t .
Me , Phoebe .
Well , I &apos;m not I &apos;m not at all surprised they feel that way .
You &apos;re not ?
See , that &apos;s why you &apos;re so great !
Actually it &apos;s , it &apos;s quite , y &apos;know , typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic .
Y &apos;know , this kind of co-dependant , emotionally stunted , sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which , I &apos;m sorry , might as well have nipples on them , and you &apos;re like all &apos; Oh , define me !
Define me !
Love me , I need love ! &apos; .
So you talked to your dad , huh .
Yeah .
He &apos;s gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted , she &apos;s gonna keep pretending she doesn &apos;t know even though she does , and my little sister Tina can &apos;t see her husband any more because he got a restraining order ... which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today .
Wow .
Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain .
So Joey , you okay ?
Yeah , I guess .
It &apos;s just parents , after a certain point , you gotta let go .
Even if you know better , you &apos;ve gotta let them make their own mistakes .
Just think , in a couple of years we get to turn into them .
If I turn into my parents , I &apos;ll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys , or ...
I &apos;ll end up like my mom .
Hey .
Hey , Pheebs .
How &apos;s it going ?
Oh , okay , except I broke up with Roger .
Awww .
Yeah , right .
Aaawwwwww ! !
What happened ?
I don &apos;t know , I mean , he &apos;s a good person , and he can be really sweet , and in some ways I think he is so right for me , it &apos;s just ...
I hate that guy !
Hey , Joey .
What &apos;s going on ?
Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express .
Next stop : Rachel Green .
Joey ! !
What the hell were you doing ? !
Sorry .
Wrong boobies .
Hello , Joey .
Oh !
... Hello , dear .
I &apos;m tellin &apos; you Ross , she wants you .
She barely knows me .
We just live in the same building .
Any contact ?
She lent me an egg once .
You &apos;re in !
Aw , right .
Hi , Ross .
Hey .
Come on , Ross , you gotta get back in the game here , ok ?
The Rachel thing &apos;s not happening , your ex-wife is a lesbianI don &apos;t think we need a third ...
Excuse me , could we get an egg over here , still in the shell ?
Thanks .
An egg ?
Yeah , you &apos;re gonna go up to her and say , &quot; Here &apos;s your egg back , I &apos;m returning your egg . &quot;
I think it &apos;s winning .
I think it &apos;s insane .
She &apos;ll love it .
Go with the egg , my friend .
Think it &apos;ll work ?
No , it &apos;s suicide .
The man &apos;s got an egg .
You can not do this .
Do what , do what ?
Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night .
No !
Phoebes !
Don &apos;t you remember why you dumped the guy ?
&apos;Cause he was creepy , and mean , and a little frightening ... alright , still , it &apos;s nice to have a date on Valentine &apos;s Day !
But Phoebe , you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year .
I know I do .
Well , what are you guys doing tomorrow night ?
Actually , tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes .
Oh , uh , listen , about tonight ... No , no , no , don &apos;t you dare bail on me .
The only reason she &apos;s goin &apos; out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend .
Yes , I know , but her friend sounds like such a ...
Pathetic mess ?
I know , butcome on , man , she &apos;s needy , she &apos;s vulnerable .
I &apos;m thinkin &apos; , cha-ching !
Thanks .
Look , you have not been out with a woman since Janice .
You &apos;re doin &apos; this .
Hi .
She said yes .
Yes !
Way to go , man !
Still got the egg , huh ?
How do I look ?
Oh , uh , I ... don &apos;t ... care .
Ok , now , remember , no trading .
You get the pretty one , I get the mess .
Hi , Joey .
Well well , look what you brought .
Very nice .
... And what did you bring ?
She &apos;s checking the coats .
Joey , I &apos;m gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands .
Will you get me a white Zinfandel , and a glass of red for Janice .
Janice ?
Oh .... my .... God .
Hey , it &apos;s Janice .
Ok , I &apos;m makin &apos; a break for it , I &apos;m goin &apos; out the window .
No , no , no , don &apos;t !
I &apos;ve been waitin &apos; for like , forever to go out with Lorraine .
Just calm down .
Calm down ?
Calm down ?
You set me up with the woman that I &apos;ve dumped twice in the last five months !
Can you stop yellin &apos; ?
You &apos;re makin &apos; me nervous , and I can &apos;t go when I &apos;m nervous .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m sorry , you &apos;re right .
Come on , do it , do it , go , come on ! ! !
Ok , ok , Roger was creepy , but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney .
Which one was Pete Carney ?
Pete the Weeper ?
Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex .
&quot; Was it good for you ? &quot;
Yeah , well , I &apos;ll take a little crying any day over Howard-the- &quot; I-win &quot; -guy .
&quot; I win !
I win ! &quot;
I went out with the guy for two monthsI didn &apos;t get to win once .
How did we end up with these jerks ?
We &apos;re good people !
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe we &apos;re some kinda magnets .
I know I am .
That &apos;s why I can &apos;t wear a digital watch .
There &apos;s more beer , right ?
Oh !
You know my friend Abby who shaves her head ?
She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle , you can do like a cleansing ritual .
Pheebes , this woman is voluntarily bald .
Yeah .
So , we can do it tomorrow night , you guys .
It &apos;s Valentine &apos;s Day .
It &apos;s perfect .
Ok , well , what kind of ritual ?
Ok . We can , um , we can burn the stuff they gave us .
Or ?
Or ... or we can chant and dance around naked , you know , with sticks .
Burning &apos;s good .
Burning &apos;s good .
Yeah , I got stuff to burn .
You know , ever since I was little , I &apos;ve been able to pick up quarters with my toes .
Good for you .
Uh , quarters or rolls of quarters ?
By the way , Chandler .
I cut you out of all my pictures .
So if you want , I have a bag with just your heads .
That &apos;s OK . Oh , are you sure ?
Really ?
Because you know , you could make little puppets out of them , and you could use them in your theater of cruelty .
We can &apos;t do that .
What ?
What can &apos;t you do ?
Uh , can I talk to you for a second , over there ?
Uh , we might be leaving now .
Tell me it &apos;s &quot; you and me &quot; we .
She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off .
I &apos;m not even sure what slathering is , but I definitely want to be a part of it .
Ok , you can not do this to me .
You &apos;re right , I &apos;m sorry .
You &apos;re right .
Uh , can we have three chocolate mousses to go please ?
I &apos;m outta here .
Here &apos;s my credit card .
Dinner &apos;s on me .
I &apos;m sorry , Chandler .
I hope she throws up on you .
So ... Just us .
Oh , what a crappy night !
Although , I have enjoyed the fact that , uh your shirt &apos;s been stickin &apos; outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom .
Excuse me .
How ya doin &apos; ?
So , do we have the best friends or what ?
Joey &apos;s not a friend .
He &apos;s ... a stupid man who left us his credit card .
Another drink ?
Some dessert ?
A big screen TV ?
I will go for that drink .
You got it .
Good woman !
Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne ?
Each .
That &apos;s right , each .
Oh , and a uh Rob Roy .
I &apos;ve always wanted to know ...
Happy Valentine &apos;s Day !
Oh , I miss you already .
Can you believe this happened ?
No ... no !
And yet it did .
Good-bye , Janice .
Kiss me !
Oh , Chandler , sorry .
Ohhh , Chandler , sorry !
Hey , Janice .
Hi , Monica .
Ok , well , this was very special .
Rach , come see who &apos;s out here !
Oh my god .
Janice , hi !
Janice is gonna go away now .
I &apos;ll be right back .
Oh , Joey , look who it is .
Whoa .
Oh , good , Joey &apos;s home now .
This is so fun .
This is like a reunion in the hall .
Oh , hi , Ross .
Yeah .
There &apos;s someone I want you to say hi to .
He just happened to call .
Hi , Ross .
Yes , it &apos;s me .
How did you know ?
I &apos;m just sayin &apos; if dogs do experience jet lag , then , because of the whole um , seven dog years to one human year thing , then , when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles , he doesn &apos;t just lose three hours , he loses like a week and a half .
That &apos;s funny .
Who are they ?
The blond woman is my ex-wife , and the woman touching her is her ... close , personal friend .
You mean they &apos;re lovers .
If you wanna put a label on it .
Wow , uh , anything else I should know ?
Nope , nope , that &apos;s it .
Oh , and she &apos;s pregnant with my baby .
I always forget that part .
Helloo !
Ok , so now we need , um sage branches and the sacramental wine .
All I have is , is oregano and a Fresca .
Um , that &apos;s ok !
Ok . All right .
Now we need the semen of a righteous man .
Ok , Pheebs , you know what , if we had that , we wouldn &apos;t be doing the ritual in the first place .
Can we just start throwing things in ?
Ok , yeah , ok . Oh , OK . Ok , Barry &apos;s letters .
Adam Ritter &apos;s boxer shorts .
Ok , and I have the , uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah .
Look , here &apos;s a picture of Scotty Jared naked .
Hey he &apos;s wearing a sweater .
No .
Eww !
And here we have the last of Paulo &apos;s grappa .
Hey , Rachel , isn &apos;t that stuff almost pure ... How can I dump this woman on Valentine &apos;s day ?
I don &apos;t know .
You dumped her on New Year &apos;s .
Oh , man .
In my next life , I &apos;m coming back as a toilet brush .
Hello , funny Valentine .
Hi , Just Janice .
Hello , Joey , our little matchmaker .
I could just kiss you all over , and I &apos;m gonna !
If you don &apos;t do it , I will .
So , um , what do you do for a living ?
Well , um , for the past few years I &apos;ve been working .. ... which is funny because , that wasn &apos;t even my major .
Oh no .
I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you .
I thought they could ... I &apos;ll try to get back as soon as I can .
I &apos;m sorry .
Now that is funny .
Hey , do you think ... would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us ?
&apos;Cause she &apos;s , she &apos;s alone now , and pregnant , and , and sad .
I guess .
Are you sure ?
Great .
Carol ?
Wanna come over and join us ?
Oh , no no no .
I &apos;m fine .
I &apos;m fine .
Come on .
These people &apos;ll scooch down .
You guys &apos;ll scooch , won &apos;t you ?
Let &apos;s try scooching !
Come on .
Come on .
Uh , Kristen Riggs , this is Carol Willick .
Carol , Kristin .
Uh , Carol teaches sixth grade .
And , Kristin , Kristin ... ... does something that , funnily enough , wasn &apos;t even her major !
What do we got there ?
A piece of something : boxer shorts , greeting cards , and what looks like a half-charred pictureWow , that guy &apos;s hairier than the Chief !
You know , it &apos;s a really funny story how this happened .
It &apos;s all right .
It &apos;s all right .
You don &apos;t have to explain .
This isn &apos;t the first boyfriend bonfire that we &apos;ve seen get out of control .
You &apos;re our third call tonight .
Really ?
Oh , sure , Valentine &apos;s is our busiest night of the year .
I brought you something .
Is it loaded ?
Oh , little candy hearts .
Chan and Jan Forever .
I had them made special .
Ok , Janice .
Janice .
Hey , Janice .
Look , there &apos;s no way for me to tell you this .
At least there &apos;s no new way for me to tell you this .
I just don &apos;t things are gonna work out .
That &apos;s fine .
It is ?
Mmm-hmm .
Because I know that this isn &apos;t the end .
Oh no , you see , actually it is .
No , it isn &apos;t , because you won &apos;t let that happen .
Don &apos;t you know it yet ?
You love me , Chandler Bing .
Oh , no I don &apos;t .
Well then ask yourself this .
Why do you think we keep ending up together ?
New Year &apos;s ?
Who invited who ?
Valentine &apos;s ?
Who asked who into whose bed ?
I did , but ... You seek me out .
Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn .
Janice , Janice .
You want me .
You need me .
You can &apos;t live without me .
And you know it .
You just don &apos;t know you know it .
See ya .
Call me !
It &apos;s not true .
I never called your mother a wolverine .
You did so .
I swear , I swear How long has she been in the bathroom ?
Uh , I don &apos;t think she &apos;s in the bathroom .
Her coat is gone .
Well maybe it &apos;s cold in there .
Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years .
That could be it .
Oh , god .
You know , this is still pretty hot .
Mushroom .
Smile .
They won &apos;t all be like this .
Some women might even stay through dinner .
Sorry , that &apos;s not funny No , it &apos;s just ... you know the whole &quot; getting on with your life &quot; thing .
Well , do I have to ?
I mean , I &apos;m sitting here with this cute woman , and , and , and she &apos;s perfectly nice , and , but that there &apos;s , that &apos;s it .
And um , and then I &apos;m here talkin &apos; to you , and , and it &apos;s easy , and it &apos;s fun , and , and I don &apos;t , I don &apos;t have to ... You know , here &apos;s a wacky thought .
Um , what &apos;s say you and I give it another shot ?
No no no , I know what you &apos;re gonna say , you &apos;re a lesbian .
But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know ?
Let &apos;s just stick a pin in it , ok ?
Because , we &apos;re great together , you know .
You can &apos;t deny it .
Besides , you &apos;re carrying my baby .
I mean , how perfect is that ?
But see , you know , you keep sayin &apos; that , but there &apos;s somethin &apos; right here .
I love you .
Oh , I love you too .
But ... No but , no but .
You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it ?
It &apos;s time to take the pin out .
You &apos;ll find someone , I know you will .
The right woman is just waiting for you .
That &apos;s easy for you to say , you found one already .
All you need is a woman who likes men and you &apos;ll be set .
Not her .
We get off around midnight , why don &apos;t we pick you up then ?
So , um , will you bring the truck ?
I &apos;ll even let you ring the bell .
Oh , my god .
See , there you go , the cleansing works !
They &apos;re nice guys .
Oh , they &apos;re firemen guys .
You guys tell them you were married ?
No way !
Are you kidding ?
My girlfriend doesn &apos;t know , I &apos;m not gonna tell them !
Coffee .
Thank you .
Cappuccino .
Grazie .
And a nice hot cider for Monica .
Aww , thank you .
Uh Rach ?
Yeah ?
Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser ?
Oh !
That &apos;s why .
I &apos;m sorry !
Chandler .
Mrs. Tedlock .
You &apos;re looking lovely today .
And may I say , that is a very flattering sleeve length on you .
Yes .
Well , Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day .
Oh , listen .
If this is about those prank memos , I had nothing to do with them .
Really .
Nothing at all .
Really .
Nothing .
Hey you guys !
Chandler &apos;s coming and he says he has , like , this incredible news , so when he gets here , we could all act like , you know ... Hey !
Hey !
Never mind .
But it was going to be really good .
What &apos;s going on ?
What is it ?
So , it &apos;s a typical day at work .
I &apos;m inputting my numbers , and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor .
That &apos;s great !
So ....
I quit .
Why ?
Why ?
This was supposed to be a temp job !
Yeah , Chandler ... you &apos;ve been there for five years .
If I took this promotion , it &apos;d be like admitting that this is what I actually do .
So was it a lot more money ?
It doesn &apos;t matter .
I just don &apos;t want to be one of those guys that &apos;s in his office until twelve o &apos;clock at night worrying about the WENUS .
... the WENUS ?
Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems .
A processing term .
Oh .
That WENUS .
So what &apos;re you going to do ?
I don &apos;t know .
That &apos;s the thing .
I don &apos;t know what I want to do .
I just know I &apos;m not going to figure it out working there .
Oooh !
I have something you can do !
I have this new massage client ... Steve ?
Anyway , he &apos;s opening up a restaurant and he &apos;s looking for a head chef .
Um ... hi there .
Hi !
Oh , yeah , no , I know .
You &apos;re a chef .
I know , and I thought of you first , but um , Chandler &apos;s the one who needs a job right now , so .... Yeah ...
I just don &apos;t have that much cheffing experience .
Unless it &apos;s an all-toast restaurant .
Yeah , yeah !
Well , what kind of food is he looking for ?
Well , he wants to do some ecclectic , so he &apos;s looking for someone who can , you know , create the entire menu .
Oh my God !
Yeah , I know !
So , what do you think ?
Thanks , Phoebe .
But I just don &apos;t really see myself in a big white hat .
OK . Oh Monica !
Guess what !
Can you see my nipples through this shirt ?
No .
But don &apos;t worry , I &apos;m sure they &apos;re still there .
Where are you going , Mr. Suity-Man ?
Well , I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman , career counselor a-gogo .
I added the &quot; a-gogo . &quot;
Career counselor ?
Hey , you guys all know what you want to do .
I don &apos;t !
Hey , you guys in the living room all know what you want to do .
You know , you have goals .
You have dreams .
I don &apos;t have a dream .
Ah , the lesser-known &quot; I don &apos;t have a dream &quot; speech .
Oh , I love my life , I love my life !
Ooh !
Brian &apos;s Song !
The meeting with the guy went great ?
So great !
He showed me where the restaurant &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s this , it &apos;s this cute little place on 10th Street .
Not too big , not too small .
Just right .
Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears ?
So anyway , I &apos;m cooking dinner for him Monday night .
You know , kind of like an audition .
And Phoebe , he really wants you to be here , which will be great for me because then you can &apos; ooh &apos; and &apos; ahh &apos; and make yummy noises .
What are you going to make ?
Yummy noises .
And Monica , what are you going to make ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s just going to be so great !
Ooh !
I know what you could make !
I know !
Oh , you should definitely make that thing ... you know , with the stuff ?
You know , that thing ... with the stuff ... ?
OK , I don &apos;t know .
Hey guys , does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood ?
How about Tony &apos;s ?
If you can finish a 32-ounce steak , it &apos;s free .
OK , ahem , hey , does anybody know a good place if you &apos;re not dating a puma ?
Who are you going out with ?
Oh , is this the bug lady ?
Bzzzz ....
I love you , Ross .
Her name is Celia .
She &apos;s not a bug lady .
She &apos;s curator of insects at the museum .
So what are you guys going to do ?
Oh , I just thought we could go out to dinner , and then maybe bring her back to my place and I &apos;d introduce her to my monkey .
And he &apos;s not speaking metaphorically .
So .... back to your place ... you thinking , maybe ... huh-huh ?
Well , I don &apos;t know .... huh-huh .... but I &apos;m hoping huh-huh .
I &apos;m telling you , that monkey is a chick magnet !
She &apos;s going to take one look at his furry , cute little face and it &apos;ll seal the deal .
Celia , don &apos;t worry !
Don &apos;t scream !
He &apos;s not going to hurt you !
Soothing tones , Celia .
Soothing tones !
Marcel ...
I can &apos;t stand this !
He &apos;s got his claws in my ... Alright ... OK , try this salmon mousse .
Mmmm .
Good .
Is it better than the other salmon mousse ?
It &apos;s creamier .
Yeah , well , is that better ?
I don &apos;t know .
We &apos;re talking about whipped fish , Monica .
I &apos;m just happy I &apos;m keeping it down , y &apos;know ?
My God !
What happened to you ?
Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests , intelligence tests , personality tests ... and what do I learn ?
&quot; You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation . &quot;
That &apos;s so great !
&apos;Cause you already know how to do that !
Can you believe it ?
I mean , don &apos;t I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool ?
You know , I just always pictured myself doing something ... something .
Oh Chandler , I know , I know ... oh , hey !
You can see your nipples through this shirt !
Here you go , maybe this &apos;ll cheer you up .
Ooh , you know , I had a grape about five hours ago , so I &apos;d better split this with you .
It &apos;s supposed to be that small .
It &apos;s a pre-appetizer .
The French call it an amouz-bouche .
Well .... it is amouz-ing ... Hello ?
Oh , hi Wendy !
Yeah , eight o &apos;clock .
What did we say ?
Ten dollars an hour ? ...
OK , great .
All right , I &apos;ll see you then .
Bye .
Ten dollars an hour for what ?
Oh , I asked one of the waitresses at work if she &apos;d help me out .
Waitressing ?
Uh-oh .
Well ... of course I thought of you !
But ... but ...
But , but ?
But , you see , it &apos;s just ... this night has to go just perfect , you know ?
And , well , Wendy &apos;s more of a ... professional waitress .
Oh !
I see .
And I &apos;ve sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics .
You know , I don &apos;t mean to brag , but I waited tables at Innsbruck in &apos; 76 .
Amouz-bouche ?
Talk to me .
OK .... um , a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning ... No no no .
Talk ... dirty .
Wha ... what , here ?
Yes ... Ah .... Say something ..... hot .
Er .... um ..... What ?
Um ... uh .... vulva .
Vulva ?
Alright , I panicked , alright ?
She took me by surprise .
You know , but it wasn &apos;t a total loss .
I mean , we ended up cuddling .
Whoaa ! !
You cuddled ?
How many times ? ?
Shut up !
It was nice .
I just ...
I don &apos;t think I &apos;m the dirty-talking kind of guy , you know ?
What &apos;s the big deal ?
You just say what you want to do to her .
Or what you want her to do to you .
Or what you think other people might be doing to each other .
I &apos;ll tell you what .
Just try something on me .
Please be kidding .
Why not ?
Come on !
Just , just close your eyes and tell me what you &apos;d like to be doing right now .
OK .
I &apos;m in my apartment ... .... yeah ... what else ?
That &apos;s it .
I &apos;m in my apartment , you &apos;re not there , we &apos;re not having this conversation .
Alright , look , I &apos;ll start , OK ?
Joey , please .
Come on .
Come on .
Alright , ready , look !
Oh ... Ross .... you get me so hot .
I want your lips on me now .
Wow .
Alright , now you say something .
I ... ahem ...
I really don &apos;t think so .
Come on !
You like this woman , right ?
Yeah .
You want to see her again , right ?
Sure .
Well if you can &apos;t talk dirty to me , how &apos;re you going to talk dirty to her ?
Now tell me you want to caress my butt !
OK , turn around .
I just don &apos;t want you staring at me when I &apos;m doing this .
Alright , alright .
I &apos;m around .
Go ahead .
Ahem ...
I want .... OK , I want to ... feel your ... hot , soft skin with my lips .
There you go !
Keep going .
Keep going !
I , er ...
I want to take my tongue ... and ... .... and .... Say it ... say it !
... run it all over your body until you &apos;re ... trembling with ... with ...
.... with ? ?
Funny story !
You &apos;re not going to believe this !
It &apos;s OK .
It &apos;s OK .
I was always rooting for you two kids to get together .
Hey Chandler , while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again .
Again ?
And again , and again , and again ... Hello ?
And again .
Hey Mr. Kostelic !
How &apos;s life on the fifteenth floor ?
Yeah , I miss you too .
Yeah , it &apos;s a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home , you know ?
Well , that &apos;s very generous er , but look , this isn &apos;t about the money .
I need something that &apos;s more than a job .
I need something I can really care about .... And that &apos;s on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier ?
Look , Al , Al ...
I &apos;m not playing hardball here , OK ?
This is not a negotiation , this is a rejection !
No !
No !
No , stop saying numbers !
I &apos;m telling you , you &apos;ve got the wrong guy !
You &apos;ve got the wrong guy !
I &apos;ll see you on Monday !
Well ?
Wow !
It &apos;s huge !
It &apos;s so much bigger than the cubicle .
Oh , this is a cube .
Look at this !
Oh !
You have a window !
Yes indeedy !
With a beautiful view of ... Oh look !
That guy &apos;s peeing !
OK , that &apos;s enough of the view .
Check this out , look at this .
Sit down , sit down .
OK .
This is great !
Helen , could you come in here for a moment ?
Thank you Helen , that &apos;ll be all .
Last time I do that , I promise .
Wendy , we had a deal !
Yeah , you promised !
Wendy !
Wendy !
Wendy !
Who was that ?
Wendy bailed .
I have no waitress .
Oh ... that &apos;s too bad .
Bye bye .
Ten dollars an hour .
No .
Twelve dollars an hour .
Mon .
I wish I could , but I &apos;ve made plans to walk around .
You know , Rachel , when you ran out of your wedding , I was there for you .
I put a roof over your head , and if that means nothing to you ... twenty dollars an hour .
Done .
Well hello !
Welcome to Monica &apos;s .
May I take your coat ?
Hi Steve !
Hello , Monica .
Hello , greeter girl .
This is Rachel .
Yeah , OK . Mmmmmm !
Everything smells so delicious !
You know , I can &apos;t remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of , OK , smells .
It &apos;s a lovely apartment .
Oh , thank you .
Would you like a tour ?
I was just being polite , but , alright .
What &apos;s up ?
In the cab , on the way over , Steve blazed up a doobie .
What ?
Smoked a joint ?
You know , lit a bone ?
Weed ?
Hemp ?
Ganja ?
OK , OK .
I &apos;m with you , Cheech .
OK . Is it dry in here ?
Let me , let me get you some wine !
Yeah , I think we &apos;re ready for our first course .
OK , um , these are rot-shrimp ravioli , and celantro pondou sauce ... ... with just a touch of mints ... and ... ... ginger .
Well , smack my ass and call me Judy !
These are fantastic !
I &apos;m so glad you liked them !

Excuse me ?

You know , I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m looking for .
Ah , cool !

That &apos;s it !
Dinner is over !

It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard .
I mean , there were characters , plot lines , themes , a motif ... at one point there were villagers .
Whoa !
And the ... huh-huh ?
Well , ahem ... you know , by the time we &apos;d finished with all the dirty talk , it was kinda late ... and we were both kind of exhausted , so uh ... You cuddled .

Okay ... Let me put it this way .
Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn ?
Ooh !
Bath salts would be nice .
Ooh , okay ... good .
What is this place ?
Look , youre cold , I have to pee , and ... .. theres a cup of coffee on the window .
How bad could it be ?
I think we have an answer .
Whats she doing here ?
This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home .
Think she got fired at Riffs ?
No , no , no .
We were there last night .
She kept ... .. bringing swordfish .

And some biscottie cookies .
Good choice .
Definitely her .
Yeah .
I cant believe you .
You still havent told that girl she doesnt have a job yet ?
Well , you still havent taken down the Christmas lights .
Congratulations , I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument .
Im just trying to find the right moment , you know ?
Oh , well , that shouldnt be so hard , now that youre dating .
&quot; Sweetheart , youre fired , but how bout a quickie before I go to work ? &quot;
Hey .
Hey .
You know , once youre inside , you dont have to knock any more .
I &apos;ll get it .
Oh .
Hi , Mr.Heckles.
Youre doing it again .
Were not doing anything .
Were just sitting around talking , quietly .
I can hear you through the ceiling .
My cats cant sleep .
You dont even have cats .
I could have cats .
Goodbye Mr.Heckles.
Well try to keep it down .
Phoebe , could you do me a favour ?
Could you try this on ?
I just wanna make sure it fits .
Ooh , my first birthday present ... .. oh , this is really ... Oh , no no no .
Its for Ursula .
I just figured , you know , size-wise .
Ohhh ... Sure , yeah ... .. okay , it fits .
Are you seein her again tonight ?
Yep .
Ice Capades .
Wow , this is serious .
Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade .
I dont know .
I like her , you know .
Shes different .
Theres uh , somethin about her .
That you like , we get it .
You like her .
Great !
Hey , Phoebe , I asked you , and you said it was okay .
Alright , well , maybe now its not okay .
Okay ... Well maybe now I &apos;m not okay with it not being okay .
Okay .
Knit , good woman , knit , knit !
And thats the Chrysler Building right there .
Nina .
Mr.Douglas ... .. cool tie .
Shes still here .
Yes , yes she is .
Didnt I memo you on this ?
See , after I let her go , err , I got a call from her psychiatrist , Dr. Flanen-nen , Dr. Flanen , Dr. Flan .
And err , he informed me that uh , she took the news rather badly , in fact , he uh , mentioned the word frenzy .
Youre kidding ?
She seems so ... Oh , no , no .
Nina ... .. she is whooo wewee-woo whoo whoo !
In fact , if you asked her right now , she would have no recollection of being fired at all , none at all .
Thats unbelievable .
And yet , believable .
So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself , or others .
I see .
I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head .
Well , I guess thats why they call it psychology , sir .
.. a sound Mom and Dad never forget .
For this after all , is the miracle of birth .
Lights please ?
And thats having a baby .
Next week is our final class .
Susan , go deep .
This is impossible .
Its just impossible .
What is , honey ?
What that woman ... did .
I am not doin that .
Its just gonna have to stay in , thats all , everything will be the same , itll just stay in .
Carol , honey , shhh , shhh , everythings gonna be alright .
Oh , what do you know ?
No one &apos;s going up to you and saying , &quot; Hi , is that your nostril ?
Mind if we push this pot roast through it ? &quot;
Carol , Carol , sweetie .
Cleansing breath .
I know its frightening , but , big picture .
The birth part is just one day , and when its over , were all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives .
I mean , thats what this is all about , right ?
Ross ?
Ross ?
Im gonna be a father .
This is just occurring to you ?
I always knew I was havin a baby , I just never realised the baby was having me .
Oh , youre gonna be great !
Aw , how can you say that ?
I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat .
How am I gonna raise a kid ?
You know , Ross , some scientists are now saying that , that monkeys and babies are actually different .
Wherere you going ?
Out .
With ?
Yes .
Alright , could I just ask you one question ?
Have you two , you know ... like ... you know ... you know ... yet ?
Well , not that its any of your business , but , no , we havent , okay ?
You meant sex , right ?
Do you have a sec ?
Ah , sure , Nina .
Whats up ?
I dont know .
For the past couple days , people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks .
Oh , well , ah ... maybe thats because theyre ah ... jealous , of us .
Maybe .
But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors .
Ah , well , maybe thats , ah , because youre getting a big raise .
I am ?
Sure , why not ?
Oh my god !
Youre amazing !
Oh , you dont know .
Helen , could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise ?
So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel ?
What ?
Helen drinks .
Will you marry me ?
Well , I ended up telling her everything .
Oh , howd she take it ?
Pretty well .
Except for the stapler thing .
Little tip : if youre ever in a similar situation , never ever leave your hand ... .. on the desk .
Okay , I think I get how to do this .
Alright , so , can we turn this off ?
Can we just make it ... make them go away ?
Because I cant , I cant watch .
okay , Pheebs , theyre gone .
Okay .
Are you alright ?
Yeah .
Its just , you know , its this whole stupid Ursula thing , its ...
Okay , Pheebs , can I ask ?
So , hes going out with her .
I mean , is it really so terrible ?
Um , yeah .
Look , I mean , Im not saying shes like evil or anything .
She just , you know , shes always breaking my stuff .
When I was eight , and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos , so she threw it under the bus .
And then , oh , and then there was Randy Brown , who was like ... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend ?
No .
Well , but thats what he was for me .
And she you know , kind of stole him away , and then ... broke his heart ... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more .
Because he said he didnt wanna be around ... anything that looked like either one of us .
Oh ... Oh , Pheebs .
I mean , I know Joey is not my boyfriend , or my thermos , or anything , but ... Youre not gonna lose him .
Hon , you gotta talk to Joey .
Yeah .
Okay .
No , come on , he doesnt know this stuff .
If he knew how you felt .
But hes falling in love with her .
Oh please , theyve been going out a week .
They havent even slept together yet , I mean , thats not serious .
Okay ...
Okay .
Oh , okay , oh .
Oh .
Yeah , um , may we help you ?

Why , how much is this gonna cost ?
I have no idea , but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars .
Wel-wel-well what are we gonna do ?
Well there &apos;s not much we can do .
Um ... unless , unless I use yours .
Hah , no no no no no no no no no no .
well , now , wait a second , who did I just put as my &quot; In case of emergency &quot; person ?
That &apos;s insurance fraud .
Well , alright , then , forget it .
Might as well just go home .
Ow ow ow ow !
Okay , okay .
I hate this .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I love you .
Hi , um , I &apos;m gonna need a new set of these forms .
Why ?
I am really an idiot .
you see , I was filling out my friend &apos;s form , and instead of putting her information , I put mine .
You are an idiot .
.
yep , that &apos;s me , I am that stupid .
I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid .
That &apos;s nice .
No , no , with him .
I &apos;m on this field , and they , they hike me the baby ... and I , I know I &apos;ve gotta do something &apos; cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin &apos; right at me .
Tampa Bay &apos;s got a terrible team .
Right , but , it is just me and the baby , so I &apos;m thinkin &apos; they can take us .
And so I uh , hah-hah , I just heave it down field .
What are you crazy ?
That &apos;s a baby !
He should take the sack ?
Anyway , suddenly I &apos;m down field , and I realise that I &apos;m the one who &apos;s supposed to catch him , right ?
Only I know there is no way I &apos;m gonna get there in time , so I am running , and running , and that , that is when I woke up .
See I , I am so not ready to be a father .
Hey , you &apos;re gonna be fine .
You &apos;re one of the most caring , most responsible men in North America .
You &apos;re gonna make a great dad .
Yeah , Ross .
You and the baby just need better blocking .
Oh , have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room ?
Is it real expensive ?
Well , only if you order stuff .
I &apos;m takin &apos; Ursula tonight .
It &apos;s her birthday .
Wo-wo-whoa .
What about Phoebe &apos;s birthday ?
When &apos;s that ?
Tonight .
Oh , man .
What &apos;re the odds of that happening ?
You take your time .
There it is !
So what &apos;re you gonna do ?
What can I do ?
Look , I don &apos;t want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula .
And your friend Phoebe ?
Well , if she &apos;s my friend , hopefully she &apos;ll understand .
I mean , wouldn &apos;t you guys ?
Man , if you tried something like that on my birthday , you &apos;d be starin &apos; at the business end of a hissy fit .

Okay , errrr , Monica ?
Yes ?

Hi , this is my friend Rachel .

Oh good , Rach .
Thank you .
Right .

Uh , you left out the stupid part .
Not stupid .
The very cute , cute , cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night , and I said &quot; yes . &quot;
I think it &apos;s totally insane , I mean , they work for the hospital .
It &apos;s like returning to the scene of the crime .
You know , I say we blow off the dates .

Monica , they are cute , they are doctors , cute doctors , doctors who are cute !
Alright , what have we learned so far ?

Hi everybody .
Hi Betty !
Betty , Hi !
You found Betty !
Oh my god !
This is great .
Everybody I love is in the same room , Where &apos;s Joey ?
Did you see Betty ?
I tell you one thing , I wouldn &apos;t mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business .
Five years ago , if somebody had said to me , here &apos;s a tomato that looks like a prune , I &apos;d say &quot; get out of my office ! &quot;
Dad , before I was born , did you freak out at all ?
I &apos;m not freaking out , I &apos;m just saying , if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash ; Dad , dad , dad , I &apos;m talkin &apos; about the whole uh , baby thing .
Did you uh , ever get this sort of ... panicky , &quot; Oh my god I &apos;m gonna be a father &quot; kind of a thing ?
No .
Your mother really did the work .
I was busy with the business .
I wasn &apos;t around that much .
Is that what this is about ?
No , no , Dad , I was just wondering .
&apos;Cause there &apos;s time to make up for that .
We can do stuff together .
You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg .
How &apos; bout we do that ?
Thanks , Dad , really , I ju ... you know , I just , I just needed to know , um ... when did you start to feel like a father ?
Oh , well , I , I guess it musta been the day after you were born .
We were in the hospital room , your mother was asleep , and they brought you in and gave you to me .
You were this ugly little red thing , and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist .
And you squeezed it , so tight .
And that &apos;s when I knew .
So you don &apos;t wanna go to Williamsburg ?
No , we can go to Williamsburg .
Eat your fish .
Rachel , the cute doctors are here .
Okay , coming !
Hi , come on in .
Hey .
Hi , Geoffrey .
Hi .
Ah here , we brought wine .
Look at this , it &apos;s from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine , so how could we resist ?
Oh , that &apos;s great .
Look at that .
So , Monica , how &apos;s the ankle ?
It &apos;s uh ... .. well , why don &apos;t you tell them ?
After all it , is your ankle .
You know what , it &apos;s feeling a lot better , thank you , um ... Well , listen , why don &apos;t you two sit down and , and we &apos;ll get you some glasses ... okay ... STAT !
Okay , listen , I &apos;m thinking , why don &apos;t we just tell them who we really are ?
I mean , it &apos;ll be fine , I really think it &apos;ll be fine .
It will not be fine .
We &apos;ll get in trouble .
Oh , Monica !
Would you stop being such a wuss ?
A wuss ?
Excuse me for living in the real world , okay ?
So ?
So ... they sss-still seem normal .
That &apos;s because they are .
okay , but you have to admit that every time we go out ... Women we meet at the hospital ...
It turns into ... Willya relax ?
Look around .
No pagan altars , no piles of bones in the corners , they &apos;re fine .
Go like this .
I said we are not going to do it , okay ?
Sometimes you can be such a , a big baby .
I am not a baby !
You know what ?
I swear to god , just because you get so uptight every time we ... Sure , every time , you &apos;re such a princess ... You know what ?
What ?
You know what ?
What ! ?
You know what ?
What ! ! ?
Every day , you are becoming more and more like your mother .
Hello !
Here we go !
This is a great place .
How long have you lived here ?
Thanks !
I &apos;ve been here about six years , and Rachel moved in a few months ago .
Yeah ... .. see , I was supposed to get married , but , um , I left the guy at the altar .
Really ?
Yeah ... Yeah , I know it &apos;s pretty selfish , but haha , hey , that &apos;s me .
Why don &apos;t you try the hummus ?
So , Monica , what do you do ?
Aahh , I &apos;m a ... chef at a restaurant uptown .
Good for you .
Yeah it is , mostly because I get to boss people around , which I just love to do .
This hummus is great .
God bless the chickpea .
Oh , god , I am so spoiled ... That &apos;s it !
And by the way , have I mentioned that back in high school , I was a cow ?
I used to wet my bed .
I use my breasts to get other people &apos;s attention .
We both do that !
Monica and Rachel &apos;s apartment .

Alright , I want my monkey .
No !
Oh , c &apos;mon , Luisa !
Sorry , prom queen .
You had to be a bitch in high school , you couldn &apos;t&apos;ve been fat .

But if you take this monkey , I will lose one of the most important people in my life .
You can hate me if you want , but please do not <unk> him .
C &apos;mon , Luisa , you have a chance to be the bigger person here !
Take it !
Nope .
Alright .
Well then how about I call your supervisor , and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a <unk> ?
It &apos;ll be nice to get this off finally , won &apos;t it ?
Yes it will .
Or we can leave it on for now , that &apos;s fine .
Y &apos;know , with the right pair of <unk> , that would be a great little <unk> .
Listen , I &apos;m- I &apos;m sorry I was so hard on you before , it &apos;s just I ... Oh , Ross , c &apos;mon .
It &apos;s my fault , I almost lost your ... Yeah , but you were the one who got him back , y &apos;know ?
You , you were great .

You in the <unk> for , uh , something grape ?
That &apos;d be good .
Alright .
The , uh , the <unk> must be <unk> .
Well , so long as we &apos;re here and , uh , not on the subject , I was thinking about , uh , how mad we got at each other before , and , um , I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we , um ... Rachel .

I can &apos;t do it , I can &apos;t marry Mindy .
I think I &apos;m still in love with you .
Oh !

Then we took a walk down to <unk> &apos;s , and I told him not to , but he got me a little bottle of Chanel ... That &apos;s nice ... now , was that before or after you told him to stop calling , stop <unk> you flowers and to <unk> leave you alone , hmm ?
Right , .. well , .. we never actually got to that ... Oh , it was just so nice to see him again , y &apos;know ?
It was comfortable , it was familiar ... it was just nice !
That &apos;s , that &apos;s nice twice !
Rachel , what &apos;s going on ?
I mean isn &apos;t this the same Barry who you left at the altar ?
Duh , where &apos;ve you been ?
Yeah , but it was different with him today !
And he wasn &apos;t , like , <unk> Guy , y &apos;know ?
I mean , we had fun !
Is there anything wrong with that ?
Yes !
Why ?
I have my reasons .
Okay , how about the fact that he &apos;s engaged to another woman , who just happens to be your <unk> friend ?
All right .
All right , all right , all right , all right , I know it &apos;s stupid !
I will go see him this afternoon , and I will just put an end to it !
Wow ... Wow !

Look look !
He &apos;s doing it again , the guy with the telescope !
Oh my God !
Go away !
Stop looking in here !

You cook naked ?
Yeah , toast , oatmeal ... nothing that <unk> .
What are you looking at me for ?
I didn &apos;t know that .
What &apos;s the matter ?

Can I use your phone ?
Yeah .. uh , but for future reference , that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone .
Yes , it &apos;s working !
Why isn &apos;t she calling me back ?
Maybe she never got your message .
Y &apos;know , if you want , you can call her machine , and if she has a lot of beeps , that means she probably didn &apos;t get her messages yet .
Y <unk> &apos;t think that makes me seem a little ... ... desperate , needy , pathetic ?
Ah , you obviously saw my personal <unk> .
How many beeps ?
She <unk> .
Y &apos;see , this is where you &apos;d use that &apos; hello &apos; word we talked about .

Apparently he &apos;s reached sexual <unk> .
Hey !

So what does this mean ?

I mean , one day , he &apos;s this little thing , and before you know it , he &apos;s this little thing I can &apos;t get off my leg .
Isn &apos;t there any way you can keep him ?
No , no .
The vet says unless he &apos;s in a place where he has regular <unk> to some ... monkey <unk> , &apos; he &apos;s just gonna get <unk> .
I &apos;ve just gotta get him into a zoo .
How do you get a monkey into a zoo ?
I know that one !
... No , that &apos;s Popes into a Volkswagen .
Well , we &apos;re <unk> to a lot of them .
<unk> our first choice would be one of the bigger state <unk> , y &apos;know , like , uh , San Diego ... right ?
But that might just be a pipe dream , because , y &apos;know , he &apos;s out of state .
Uh , my vet , uh , knows someone at <unk> , so that &apos;s a possibility .
Yeah , but that &apos;s like two blocks away from the <unk> .
I mean , it &apos;s a total party zoo .
Hey .
We found her , we found the girl .
What ?
Did you call the <unk> ?
Nope .
We took her to lunch .
Ah .
Your own <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What ? !
Are you insane ?
This woman stole from you .
She stole .
She &apos;s a <unk> .
Y &apos;know what ?
After you &apos;re with this woman for like ten minutes , you forget all that .
I mean , she is this <unk> person , with this , with this amazing <unk> .
Yeah , which she probably stole from some <unk> .
... Take off their <unk> !
Popes in a Volkswagen !

No way .

Monana was very brave .
It was so wild .
We told them we were the <unk> in room six fifteen .
Only to find out the <unk> Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor !
So once they caught on to the fact that we &apos;re , y &apos;know , short and have breasts ...
... They threw us out !
I was thrown out of a hotel !
Me !

Well , you ladies are not the only ones living the dream .

I mean , I &apos;m not like you .
I-I can &apos;t even stand in front of a tap class .
Well , that &apos;s just probably &apos; cause of your Amish <unk> .
What ?
Well , you &apos;re Pennsylvania Dutch , right ?
Right .

I-I used to be just like you .
And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life .
Did you ever see Dead <unk> &apos; <unk> ?
Uh-huh .
I thought that movie was so incredibly ... <unk> .
I mean , that thing at the end where the kid <unk> himself because he can &apos;t be in the play ?
What was that ? !
It &apos;s like , kid , wait a year , leave home , do some <unk> theatre .
I walked out of there and I thought , &apos; Now , that &apos;s two hours of my life that I &apos;m never getting back . &apos;
And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do .
Wow .
Then I would definitely not <unk> Mrs. <unk> .
Oh God .
We didn &apos;t get into <unk> .
That was like our safety zoo .
They take like dogs and cows .

No-no , he &apos;s , he &apos;s very <unk> .

He can hold a <unk> , if that &apos;s <unk> mean ... How about a hammer , or a small blade ?
Why- <unk> why would he need a blade ?
Well , if he &apos;s up against a <unk> cat or an animal with <unk> , you &apos;ve got to give the little guy something .

And here &apos;s this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they &apos;re fighting over who gets to love it the most .

I just think you &apos;re nice .
Anyway , that &apos;s when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business .

Food later .
Hey , hold on there , <unk> .
How &apos;s it going ?

Well , not so good .
She definitely thinks tonight is the night we &apos;re gonna ... complete the <unk> , if you know what I ... Then you do .
Heh , heh .
So , uh , have you ever thought about being there for her ?
What do you mean ?
Y &apos;know , just be there for her .
Not following you .
Think about it .
OK , I &apos;m guessing this is from ... Well , thank you , Melanie .
OK , this one right here is from me .
OK ... ah , it &apos;s light ... ... it <unk> ... it &apos;s ... <unk> Scrabble !

This one &apos;s from Joey ... feels like a book .

And ... ... it &apos;s a book !
Oh , it &apos;s Dr. <unk> !
: That book got me through some tough times .
There is a little child inside this man !
Yes , the doctors say if they <unk> it , he &apos;ll die .
Who &apos;s this from ?
Oh , that &apos;s Ross &apos;s .
Oh ... ... Oh my God .
He remembered .
<unk> what ?
It was like months ago .
We were walking by this <unk> store , and I saw this pin in the window , and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl .
Oh !
I can &apos;t believe he remembered !
Well , sure , but can you play it on a plane ?
Oh , it &apos;s so pretty .
This must have cost him a <unk> .
I can &apos;t believe he did this .
Come on , Ross ?
Remember back in college , when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that <unk> expensive <unk> duck ?
What did you just say ?
ahem ... um ...
<unk> duck .
No , no , no .... the , um , the ... &apos; love &apos; part ?
<unk> .... <unk> .... Oh .... my God .
Oh , no-no-no-no-no .... That &apos;s good , just keep <unk> your head .
That &apos;ll turn back time .
I mean , this is unbelievable .
I know .
This is really , really huge .
No it &apos;s not .
It &apos;s small .
It &apos;s tiny .
It &apos;s <unk> .
It &apos;s <unk> .
Nuh-uh .
I don &apos;t think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again .
OK , is there a <unk> button on this woman ?
I think this is so great !
I mean , you and Ross !
<unk> you have any idea ?
No !
None !
I mean , my first night in the city , he mentioned something about asking me out , but nothing ever happened , so I just ... : <unk> , what else did he say ?
I mean , does he , like , want to go out with me ?
Well , given that he &apos;s <unk> in love with you , he probably wouldn &apos;t mind getting a cup of coffee or something .
Ross ?
All this time ?
Well , I &apos;ve got to talk to him .
<unk> &apos;s in China !
The country .
No , no , wait .
His flight doesn &apos;t leave for another forty-five more minutes .
What about the time difference ?
From here to the airport ?
Yes !
You &apos;re never gonna make it !
Rachel , what &apos;re you gonna say to him ?
I-I-I don &apos;t know .
Well then maybe you shouldn &apos;t go .
He &apos;s right , cause if you &apos;re just gonna , like , break his heart , that &apos;s the kind of thing that can wait .
Yeah , but if it &apos;s good news , you should tell him now .
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;ll know when I see him .
Here , look , alright , does this help ?
Noooo ... look , all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him .
I mean , this is just too big .
Y &apos;know , I just , I &apos;ve just gotta talk to him .
I ...
I gotta ... OK , I &apos;ll see you later .
Rachel , I love you !
<unk> with me first !
Alright !

Excuse me , pardon me , excuse me .... Hi !
Hi .

Oh , no , no , I don &apos;t have one .
I just need to talk to my friend .
Oh , <unk> .
I &apos;m sorry .
You are not allowed on the <unk> unless you have a boarding pass .
No , I know , but <unk> just went on .
He &apos;s right there , he &apos;s got the blue jacket on , I ... can I <unk> ... No no no !

OK , alright , OK , um ... then could you please , uh ... just give him a message for me ?

Excuse me , sir ?
Uh ...

Heh , heh .

Sure !
Why not ?
Boy , somebody &apos;s gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow .
Oooh , I gotta tell you ... you are nothing like I thought you would be .
How do you mean ?
I don &apos;t know , I-I guess I just had you <unk> as one of those guys who &apos;re always &apos; me , me , me . &apos;
But you ... you &apos;re a <unk> .
You &apos;re like the most generous man I ever met .
I mean ... you &apos;re <unk> a woman .
Uh , so , uh , Rach , uh ... do you wanna save this <unk> paper , I mean , it &apos;s only a little bit <unk> ... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know ...
I thought about it all the way there , and I thought about it all the way back ... and , uh , oh , you guys , y &apos;know , it &apos;s Ross .
Y &apos;know what I mean ?
I mean , it &apos;s Ross .
Sure .
I don &apos;t know , I mean , this is just my <unk> <unk> feeling ... but I &apos;m thinking ... oh , I &apos;m thinking it &apos;d be really great .
Oh my God , me too !
Oh !
Oh , we &apos;d be like <unk> !
Y &apos;know what the best part is ?
The best part is that you already know everything about him !
I mean , it &apos;s like starting on the fifteenth date !
Yeah , but , y &apos;know , it &apos;s ... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date .
Another good point .
No , I mean , I mean , when you &apos;re at the fifteenth date , y &apos;know , you &apos;re already in a very <unk> place .
Y &apos;know , it &apos;s ... you &apos;re <unk> .
Huh ?
Well , I mean , then what happens if it doesn &apos;t work out ?
Why isn &apos;t it working out ?
I don &apos;t know ... sometimes it doesn &apos;t .
Is he not cute enough for you ?
No !
Does he not make enough money ?
No , I &apos;m just .... Maybe there &apos;s someone else .
Wha ... Is there ?
Is there someone else ?
No !
There is .. there is <unk> else !
Then why the hell are you dumping my brother ? ! ?
Hey , big ... Shhhh !
... <unk> .
She &apos;s still asleep .
So how &apos;d it go ?
Oh , it was amazing .
You know how you always think you &apos;re great in bed ?
The fact that you &apos;d even ask that question <unk> how little you know me .
Well , it &apos;s like , last night , I couldn &apos;t do the thing that usually makes me great .
So I had to do all this other stuff .
And the response I got ... man , oh man , it was like a <unk> tape parade !
Yes , I know , as it happens my room is very very close to the parade <unk> .
It was amazing !
And not just for her ... <unk> .
For me , too .
It &apos;s like , all of a sudden , I &apos;m blind .
But all my other <unk> are <unk> , y &apos;know ?
It &apos;s like ...
I was able to appreciate it on another level .
I didn &apos;t know you had another level .
I know !
<unk> did I !
Hey , great <unk> !
Birthday present ?
Yeah .
Oh , from who ?
From you .
I <unk> the <unk> you got me .
Well , it &apos;s the thought .
Hey , doesn &apos;t Ross &apos;s flight get in in a couple hours ?
At gate <unk> ?
Uh , yeah .
Uh , Monica , y &apos;know , honey , I &apos;ve been thinking about it and I &apos;ve decided <unk> whole Ross thing , it &apos;s just not a good idea .
Oh , why ?
Because , I feel like I wouldn &apos;t just be going out with him .
I would be going out with all of you .
Oh , and there would just be all this pressure , and I don &apos;t wanna ... No , no , no , no , no , no pressure , no pressure !
Monica , nothing has even happened yet , and you &apos;re already so ...
I am not &apos; so &apos; !
OK , I was a <unk> bit weird at first , but ...
I &apos;ll be good .
I promise .
Who is it ?
It &apos;s me , Carl .
C &apos;mon up .
<unk> my brother &apos;s back ?
... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won &apos;t be hearing from me .
<unk> hundred bucks !
Alright , you did it !
Do we have any fruit ?
Man , hell of a two weeks , huh ?
Y &apos;know what , though ?
I really feel like I learned something .
Really ?
So , you &apos;re gonna stick with this &apos; it &apos;s all for her &apos; thing ?
What , are you crazy ?
When a blind man gets his <unk> back , does he walk around like this ?
I &apos;m just sayin &apos; , if I see one more picture of Ed <unk> , <unk> in that stupid <unk> car , I &apos;m gonna shoot myself !
I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong ...
I &apos;m not against <unk> issues per se .... it &apos;s just that guy !
I can &apos;t believe you &apos;d rather go out with him than me .
Would you excuse me , please ?
I &apos;m trying to have a date here .
Fine , just stop thinking about me .
Can &apos;t do it , can you ?
So I &apos;m thinking about you .
So what ?
I don &apos;t get it .
What do you see in this guy , anyway ?
Well ... he happens to be a very nice ... guy ....
I mean , come on , buddy , get a real car !
Rachel , come on .
Give us a chance .
Ross , it &apos;s too hard .
No , no , no ... why , because it might get weird for everyone else ?
Who cares about them .
This is about us .
Look , I-I &apos;ve been in love with you since , like , the <unk> grade .
Ross , you &apos;re like my best friend .
I know .
If we broke up , and I lost you ... Whoa , whoa , whoa .
What makes you think we &apos;re gonna break up ?
Well , have you been involved with someone where you haven &apos;t broken up ?
No .
But ... it only has to happen once .
Look , you and I both know we are perfect for each other , right ?
I mean ... so , the only question is ... are you attracted to me ?
I don &apos;t know ...
I mean , I &apos;ve never looked at you that way before .
Well , start looking .
Wow .
Exactly !
And you just know I &apos;m gonna be the guy caught behind this <unk> in traffic !
Right !
You &apos;re right !
Heh ... y &apos;know ?
You know what ?
What ?
I forgot ...
I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport .
I am so sorry !
I &apos;m so ... if you want to stay , and finish your drinks , please do ....
I <unk> &apos;m sorry .
I-I-I gotta go .
I &apos;m sorry .
But ...
Excuse me , pardon me , excuse me , excuse me , sorry .
Hi .
For God &apos;s sake , will you let it go ?
There &apos;s no Rachel !
Oh , hey , hey , I got that .
Oh , thanks , sweetie .
No problem .
I cannot wait for you to meet my friends .
Really ?
Yeah .
You don &apos;t think they &apos;ll judge and <unk> me ?
No , no , they will .
I just ... uh ... Can &apos;t wait .
Come on , they &apos;re gonna love you .
Ok , so this is pretty much what &apos;s happened so far .
Ross was in love with Rachel since , you know , forever , but every time he tried to tell her , something kind of got in the way , like cats , and Italian guys .
Finally Chandler was like &quot; forget about her &quot; but when Ross was in China on his dig , Chandler let it <unk> that Ross was in love with Rachel .
She was like , &quot; Oh my god . &quot;
So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back , but what she didn &apos;t know was , that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman .
Uh-Oh !
So , that &apos;s pretty much everything you need to know .
But , enough about us .
So , how &apos;ve you been ?
Oh my god .
Oh my god .
Excuse me .
Move !
Move !
<unk> !
Excuse me !
Rach !

And the <unk> ?
You gotta hear this story .
We &apos;re on this bus , that &apos;s <unk> 200 years old ... 200 at least .

Oh , I &apos;m so sorry .
I just gave away the ending , didn &apos;t I ?
Oh !
It &apos;s just , I just heard this story in the cab , and it is all I can think about .
This is amazing .
I mean , how , how did this happen ?
Well , Ross and I were in <unk> school together .
But we haven &apos;t seen each other since then .
Well I land in China , guess who &apos;s in charge of the dig .
Julie !
Julie , isn &apos;t that great ?
I mean , isn &apos;t that just <unk> , <unk> fantastic ?
It &apos;s an expression .
Well , we just wanted to say a quick hi , and then we &apos;re gonna go see the baby .
And then we &apos;ve gotta get some sleep .
Yeah , it &apos;s really 6 : 00 tomorrow night our time .
Well , listen , don &apos;t tell us what &apos;s gonna happen though , &apos; cause I like to be surprised .
Bye .
Hey , Rach , can I get some coffee ?
Yeah , sure .
Thank you .
Hey , Rach , can I get ... Did you talk to him ?
Not yet .
Then , no .
So what the hell happened to you in China ?
I mean , when last we left you , you were totally in love with , you know .
I know , I know I was , but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it &apos;s never gonna happen , move on .
You know whose voice that was ?
God ?
It was you , pal .
Well , maybe it was God , doing me .
Look , you were right .
She looks at me and sees a friend , that &apos;s all .
But then I met Julie , and I don &apos;t know , we &apos;re havin &apos; a great time .
And I have to say , I never would &apos;ve gone for it with her if it hadn &apos;t been for you .
Well , you owe me one , big guy .
Here &apos;s your lemonade .
I didn &apos;t order lemonade .
Oh .
Well then , you better go take that back because they &apos;re gonna charge you for that .
But ... <unk> , come on !
So uh , what did you find out ?
He said ... he said , he said that they &apos;re having a great time .
I &apos;m sorry .
But , the silver lining , if you wanna see it , is that he made the decision all by himself !
Without any outside help whatsoever .
How is that the silver lining ?
You have to really wanna see it .
<unk> , these are the guys who were picked last in gym .
Pheebes , you know what I &apos;m thinking ?
Oh , ok . How , it &apos;s been so long since you &apos;ve had sex , you &apos;re wondering if they &apos;ve changed it ?
No , although now that &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
All right , so what were you thinking ?
Well , I was thinking , that you gave the guys such great <unk> , I thought , maybe you &apos;d like to do mine ?
Ohh !
No .
Why not ?
Because , I &apos;m just , I &apos;m incredibly <unk> and an unbelievable control freak .
No you &apos;re not .
I know I &apos;m not , but you are , and I was trying to <unk> your feelings .

At his apartment .
Is this juice ?
Whoa , whoa .
And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe ?
Oh God , I know I &apos;m a pathetic <unk> .
Honey , you &apos;re not pathetic , you &apos;re sad .
People do stupid things when they &apos;re upset .
My god , if I had a <unk> for every guy I wish I hadn &apos;t ... , but this is about your horrible mistake .
Hi !
Hi .
Sorry we &apos;re late but we <unk> , there was touching .
Hey , hey Ross .

So , uh , he &apos;s back .
Yeah , he &apos;s back .
Is that a problem ?
No , not a problem .
Good !
I &apos;m glad it &apos;s not a problem .
Ok , you &apos;re gonna have to not touch my ass .
Well , in <unk> of the yummy <unk> and <unk> <unk> , I &apos;ve got pants that need to be altered .
Hey , Chandler , when you see Frankie , tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello .
He &apos;ll know what it means .
Are you sure he &apos;s gonna be able to crack that code ?
You know it &apos;s funny , the last time Paulo was here , my hair was so much shorter and cuter .
All right .
Ok , but , but !
You have to promise that you will not be all like <unk> and bossy and Monica about it .
I promise .
All right .
Now some of you are gonna get cut , and some of you aren &apos;t .
But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing .
All right , that &apos;s it , I quit .
What ?
I didn &apos;t say anything .
Yeah , but this isn &apos;t the face of a person who <unk> a person .
Ok , this is the face of a person who , you know , doesn &apos;t trust a person .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m sorry , Phoebe .
It &apos;s just a little shorter than what we had discussed .
Would you relax ?
I know what I am doing .
This is how he wears it .
How who wears it ?
Demi Moore .
Demi Moore is not a he .
Well , he was a he in <unk> , and in Ten .
That &apos;s <unk> Moore .
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore .
Oh .
Oh !
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
Oh my God !
Oh my God !

Which one &apos;s Demi Moore ?
She &apos;s the actress that was in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> !
Oh , she &apos;s got gorgeous hair .
I know !
How long do you want the <unk> ?
At least as long as I have the pants .
I just got that .
Ok , now we &apos;ll do your inseam .
How is she ?
It &apos;s too soon to tell .
She &apos;s resting , which is a good sign .
How &apos;s the hair ?
I &apos;m not gonna lie to you , Ross , it doesn &apos;t look good .
I put a <unk> on one side , which seems to have stopped the <unk> .
Can we see her ?
Your hair looks too good , I think it would upset her .
Ross , why don &apos;t you come on in .
Yeah .
How &apos;re you doing ?
I &apos;m okay .
Ooh , that bad , huh ?
What ?
Look , I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable .
It &apos;s one of my <unk> .
When I saw him get off that plane with her , I really thought I hit rock bottom .
But today , it &apos;s like there &apos;s rock bottom , 50 feet of crap , then me .
You gotta tell Ross how you feel .
Come on .
How can I just tell him ?
What about Julie ?
What about her ?
They &apos;ve only been going out for two weeks .
Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years .
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
Look , Rach , Rach !
I &apos;ve been with my share of women .
In fact , I &apos;ve been with like a lot of people &apos;s share of women .
The point is , I &apos;ve never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you .
<unk> , <unk> !
Can I talk to you for a sec ?
Your tailor is a very bad man !
Frankie ?
What &apos;re you talking about ?
Hey , what &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Joey &apos;s tailor ... took advantage of me .
What ?
No way .
I &apos;ve been going to the guy for 12 years .
Oh come on !
He said he was going to do my inseam , and he ran his hand up my leg , and then , there was <unk> ... What ?
<unk> .
That &apos;s how they do pants !
First they go up one side , they move it over , then they go up the other side , they move it back , and then they do the <unk> .
What ?
Ross , Ross , would you tell him ?
Isn &apos;t that how they measure pants ?
Yes , yes it is .
In prison !

That &apos;s not ?
Oh my God .
Even Mary Tyler Moore would &apos;ve been better .
I like it .
I do , I think it &apos;s a Ten .
Thank you .
My hair is very <unk> .
Come on , Monica , things could be worse .
You could get caught between the moon and New York City .
I know it &apos;s crazy , but it &apos;s true .
Thank you .
Well , I gotta go .
Bye .
Bye , Rach .
Wait , are you leaving ?
Yeah , that &apos;s kinda what I meant by &quot; bye ! &quot;
Well , can I talk to you for a sec ?
Okay .
Hey , when the doctor does that <unk> test ... That &apos;s ok . What &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Well , first of all , Paulo and I are not back together .
It was just a stupid thing I did , and if I could go back in time and do it again , well , I wouldn &apos;t .
Um , second of all , what ?
Ok . Well , before I say anything , I just need to know , is this one of those things where you break up with a guy , and then I tell you what I think , and then the next day you get back together with the guy , and I look like a complete idiot ?
No .
No-no-no-no .
Well , then , I think , I think the guy is scum .
I hate him .
I mean I <unk> physically hate him .
I always have .
You are way too good to be with a guy like that .
Really ?
You deserve to be with someone who <unk> you , and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing , and adorable , and sexy you are , you know ?
Someone who <unk> up every morning thinking &quot; Oh my god , I &apos;m with Rachel &quot; .
You know , someone who makes you feel good , the way I am with Julie .
Was there a second of all ?
No , I think that was the whole all .
Okay .
Okay .
Okay .
I swear to god , Dad .
That &apos;s not how they measure pants .
I was thinking of doing it a little shorter , you know , like Andie McDowell &apos;s new haircut ?
Oh yeah !
Oh , I can do that .
Really ?
You wanna do it right now ?
Great !
Ok , I just wanna be really sure this time .
Andie McDowell &apos;s the girl from Four <unk> and a <unk> , right ?

Oh , yeah .
Ok , thank you .
You &apos;re welcome .

Ok . What did you just do ?
I <unk> my arm , what ?
It &apos;s breast milk .
So ?
Phoebe , that is juice , squeezed from a person .
What is the big deal ?
What did you just do ?
Ok , would people stop drinking the breast milk ?
You won &apos;t even taste it ?
No !
Not even if you just <unk> that it &apos;s milk ?
Not even if Carol &apos;s breast had a picture of a missing child on it .
Hey , where is everybody ?
They took Ben to the park .
Where &apos;ve you been ?
Just out .
Had some lunch , just me , little quality time with me .

Oh , no problem .
You can borrow it , by the way .
Here are your keys , <unk> .
Okay .
Mon , if uh you were at lunch alone , how come it cost you uh <unk> dollars ?
You know what probably happened ?
Someone musta stolen my credit card .
And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket ?
That is an excellent excellent question .

Monica , what is with you ?
Who &apos;d you have lunch with ?
Judy .
Who ?

You were with Julie ?
Look , when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother &apos;s girlfriend .
And then , one thing <unk> to another and , before I knew it , we were ... shopping .
Oh .
Oh my God .
Honey , wait .
We only did it once .
It didn &apos;t mean anything to me .
Yeah , right .
Sure !
Really , Rachel , I was thinking of you the whole time .
Look , I &apos;m sorry , all right .
I never meant for you to find out !
Oh , please , you wanted to get caught .
That is not true !
Oh , so you just sort of happened to leave it in here ?
Did it ever <unk> to you that I might just be that stupid ?
Ok , Monica .
I just have to know one thing .
Did you go with her to Bloomingdale &apos;s ?
Oh !
Ok , ok , ok , I just really , uh , I just really need to not be with you right now .
Hi , who &apos;s this ?
Hi , Joanne .
Is Rachel working ?
It &apos;s Monica .
Yes , I know I did a horrible thing .
Joanne , it &apos;s not as <unk> as all that , ok ?
No , I don &apos;t care what Steve thinks .
Hi , Steve .
Hey !
How did we do ?
Oh , I tasted Ben &apos;s milk , and Ross freaked out .
I did not freak out .
Why &apos;d you freak out ?
Because it &apos;s breast milk .
It &apos;s gross .
My breast milk is gross ?
This should be fun .
No , no , Carol .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
I just , I just don &apos;t think breast milk is for adults .
Of course the <unk> does <unk> to grown-ups and kids <unk> .
Ross , you &apos;re being silly .
I &apos;ve tried it , it &apos;s no big deal .
Just taste it .
That would be no .
Come on .
It doesn &apos;t taste bad .
Yeah , it &apos;s kinda sweet , sorta like , uh ... <unk> juice .
Exactly .
You &apos;ve tasted it ?
You &apos;ve tasted it .
Uh huh .
Oh , you &apos;ve tasted it .
You can keep saying it , but it won &apos;t stop being true .
Gimme the bottle .
Gimme the towel .
<unk> .
Gimme a box a juice .
Well , they switched me over to Hombre .
Well , maybe it &apos;s because of the way you &apos;re dressed .
Or maybe it &apos;s because this guy &apos;s doing so good they wanna put more people on it .
You should see this guy , Chandler , he goes through two <unk> a day .
What do you care ?
You &apos;re an actor .
This is your day job .
This isn &apos;t supposed to mean anything to you .
I know , but , I was the best , you know ?
I liked being the best .
I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I should just get outta the game .
They need guys up in <unk> to serve cheese .
All right , say you do that .
You know sooner or later somebody &apos;s gonna come along that <unk> a better <unk> .
And then where &apos;re you gonna run ?
Yeah I guess you &apos;re right .
You &apos;re damn right I &apos;m right .
I say you show this guy what you &apos;re made of .
I say you stand your <unk> .
I say you show him that you are the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
I &apos;m gonna do it .
All right .
Now go see Miss <unk> and she &apos;ll fix you up with a nice hooker .
I don &apos;t know what else to say .
Well that works out good , because I &apos;m not listening .
I feel terrible , I really do .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry , did my back hurt your <unk> ?
Rachel , say that I &apos;m friends with her , we spend some time together .
Is that so terrible ?
Yes .
It &apos;s that terrible ?
Yes .
Monica , you don &apos;t get it .
It &apos;s bad enough that she &apos;s stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with , but now , she &apos;s actually , but now she &apos;s actually stealing you .
Me ?
What are you talking about ?
Nobody could steal me from you .
I mean , just because I &apos;m friends with her doesn &apos;t make me any less friends with you .
I mean , you &apos;re my ... We &apos;re , we &apos;re ... Oh , I love you .
I love you too .
You guys , um I know that this really doesn &apos;t have anything to do with me , but um I love you guys too .
Oh , I really needed that .
Look , I know that you &apos;re in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie &apos;s guts , but she didn &apos;t do anything wrong .
I mean , she was just a girl who met a guy , and now they go out .
I really think that if you gave her a chance , you &apos;d like her .
Would you just give that a chance , for me ?
I &apos;d do anything for you , you know that .
I &apos;d do anything for you .
Wait , wait , wait , wait !
Mornin &apos; .
I said , <unk> &apos; .
I heard ya .
All right , everybody , I &apos;m <unk> &apos; the <unk> .
You boys ready ?
Ready .
Yeah , I &apos;m ready .
You idiot , you stupid cowboy , you <unk> me , I &apos;m <unk> !
Oh my god , <unk> !
What the hell did you do ?
I &apos;m sorry .
I am such a <unk> .
I &apos;m so sorry , I &apos;m so sorry .
My god , what happened ?
These new kids , they never last .
<unk> or later , they all ... stop <unk> &apos; .
Listen , uh , what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now ?
Sure .
So .
So .
I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit .
I mean , you know , we &apos;ve never really talked .
I guess you &apos;d know that , being one of the two of us , though , right ?
I know , I probably shouldn &apos;t even tell you this , but I &apos;m pretty much totally intimidated by you .
Really ?
Me ?
Yes .
Oh my god , are you kidding ?
Ross is so crazy about you , and I really wanted you to like me , and , it &apos;s probably me being totally paranoid , but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don &apos;t .
Well , you &apos;re not totally paranoid .
<unk> .
Um , ok , uh , oh god , um , when you and uh Ross first started going out , it was really hard for me , um , for many reasons , which I &apos;m not gonna <unk> you with now , but um , I just , I see how happy he is , you know , and how good you guys are together , and um , Monica &apos;s always saying how nice you are , and god I hate it when she &apos;s right .
Thanks .
Hey , listen , would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?
Yeah , that &apos;d be great .
I &apos;d love it .
I &apos;d love it too .
Shoot , I gotta go .
So , I &apos;ll talk to you later .
All right , Julie .

I &apos;m tellin &apos; you , she <unk> back , I could see her brain .
How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial <unk> things ?
Hold it hold it .
I gotta side with Chandler on this one .
When I first moved to the city , I went out a couple of times with this girl , really hot , great <unk> , but she had the biggest Adam &apos;s apple .
It made me nuts .
You or me ?
I got it .
Uh , Joey , women don &apos;t have Adam &apos;s apples .

Yeah .
That was a good one .
For a second there , I was like , &quot; whoa . &quot;

But now I know I don &apos;t have a choice about this , I was born this way .

Uh-huh .
And then , I don &apos;t know , I mean you &apos;d pull me really close to you so that , so that I &apos;d be <unk> up , you know , right against you .
