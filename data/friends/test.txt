&quot; Run away from Crazy Snake Man , &quot; they &apos;ll <unk> !
You have got to get over this .
You &apos;re not gonna end up alone .

But now I know I don &apos;t have a choice about this , I was born this way .
I , I don &apos;t know what to say .
I mean , you know , you &apos;re married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says , &apos; Oh , I &apos;m not gay . &apos;

Uh-huh .
And then , I don &apos;t know , I mean you &apos;d pull me really close to you so that , so that I &apos;d be <unk> up , you know , right against you .
